16531,M27708073,Exploring Path Models of Disablement in Residential Care and Assisted Living Residents.,"This study examined the relationships between individual and environmental factors and physical activity, and between physical activity and functional limitations and disability in residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) residents. Participants completed questionnaires and physical performance tests, and wore the Fitbit Motion TrackerÂ® to capture physical activity. Model fit was analyzed using two-level path models with residents nested within RC/AL settings. Model parameters were estimated using the MPlus robust maximum likelihood method. A multilevel model with good fit (root mean square error of approximation = 0.07, comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.91) showed that persons with greater exercise self-efficacy were more physically active, and persons who were more physically active had better physical function and less disability. Setting-level factors did not significantly correlate with physical activity or disability. Although environmental factors may influence physical activity behavior, only individual factors were associated with physical activity in this sample of RC/AL residents.",eng,0.8025376463184763

ADL functioning assessed via Maryland Appraisal of Patient Progress (MAPP); medical data collected through chart review; ophthalmological data obtained through dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist.!##!Results!#!In comparison with residents having good vision (n = 52), a significantly greater proportion of residents with low vision (n = 51) were dependent on caregivers for performing ADLs (eg, toileting, transferring, washing). Residents with low vision had significantly more eye pathology (eg, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration) than did residents with good vision. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to presence of musculoskeletal problems (eg, arthritis) or number of medical conditions (eg, cardiovascular disorder, cerebrovascular accident).!##!Conclusions!#!There is a strong link between low vision and ADL disability in nursing home residents. Moreover, ADL dependency is significantly related to the presence of eye disorders.",eng,0.8017087340428365
80049,M19177977,Teaching at an assisted living facility.,"The increase in assisted living facilities (ALFs) of various types has provided a new option for the delivery of clinical services to the elderly. For all these facilities, whether large or small, profit or nonprofit, primarily residential (the ""social model"") or with significant nursing care (the ""new"" model), their sole mission is to provide an appropriate level of residential and clinical services to their residents. However, given the rise in the number and variety of these facilities, there may be other uses to which they can be put. Specifically, these facilities may make excellent sites for the education and training of health care personnel. Acute care hospitals and nursing homes primarily deliver clinical services, but both are common sites for the training of a variety of health care personnel, both professional and nonprofessional. This article examines the teaching programs at one ALF and explores some possibilities for the future.",eng,0.7978816954872822

Over 14 months, while her home care agency reacted to the Balanced Budget Act, nine interviews were done with a 95-year-old woman who lived alone until she moved to an assisted living facility. Data analysis yielded structures of her changing experience of home care. Although primarily supportive services may have been inconsistent with Medicare regulations, such services may have influenced the favorable outcomes of sustaining elders at home and undergirding the rural economy.",eng,0.79589557384063

The aim of the present study was to investigate the end-of-life wishes and decision making among Japanese elderly people who required home care services. The study was designed to qualitative research strategies, using face to face interview data recorded in nursing care records, with a focus on advance care planning.!##!Design and methods!#!A total of 102 elderly people (47 males, 55 females) of 6 home care support offices in Hyogo prefecture participated.!##!Results and implications!#!We finally extracted the following 5 themes: anxiety about the future, abandonment of control, clinging to current daily life, precarious mutual support, delegating decision-making. While elderly people living at home generally feel anxious and fearful about the future, they seemed to try to avoid thinking too seriously about possible complications in their life. They also tend to leave end-of-life decision to someone else, and their decisions tend to change as they advance in age and as their condition deteriorates. Our findings suggest that medical professionals and care managers always support their patients' decisions, allowing for the views of the informal caregivers on whom elderly people rely for decision-making.",eng,0.7777048589711819
104208,M28295145,Variation in Hospice Services by Location of Care: Nursing Home Versus Assisted Living Facility Versus Home.,"Objectives!#!To describe differences in hospice services for patients living at home, in nursing homes or in assisted living facilities, including the overall number and duration of visits by different hospice care providers across varying lengths of stay.!##!Design!#!Retrospective cohort study using hospice patient electronic medical record data.!##!Setting!#!Large, national hospice provider.!##!Participants!#!Data from 32,605 hospice patients who received routine hospice care from 2009 to 2014 were analyzed.!##!Measurements!#!Descriptive statistics were calculated for utilization measures for each type of provider and by location of care. Frequency and duration of service contacts were standardized to a 1 week period and pairwise comparisons were used to detect differences in care provided between the three settings.!##!Results!#!Minimal differences were found in overall intensity of service contacts across settings, however, the mix of services were different for patients living at home versus nursing home versus assisted living facility. Overall, more nurse care was provided at the beginning and end of the hospice episode; intensity of aide care services was higher in the middle portion of the hospice episode. Nearly 43% of the sample had hospice stays less than 2 weeks and up to 20% had stays greater than 6 months.!##!Conclusion!#!There are significant differences between characteristics of hospice patients in different settings, as well as the mix of services they receive. Medicare hospice payment methodology was revised starting in 2016. While the new payment structure is in greater alignment with the U shape distribution of services, it will be important to evaluate the impact of the new payment methodology on length of stay and mix of services by different providers across settings of care.",eng,0.7761719004317233

The women were divided according to whether they lived alone, with spouse only, or with persons other than (or in addition to) the spouse. Those living alone were found to have lower life satisfaction, lower self-esteem, and higher social dysfunction than those living with spouse or others. No differences were found with respect to depression, somatization, diet, or activity level. There was a significant interaction effect between race and living arrangement with respect to anxiety, with blacks being less anxious than whites when living with others, and more anxious when living alone or with only a spouse.",eng,0.7718927641158706

The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence rate of falls in a national, representative sample of Israeli elderly and to examine the association of falls with selected medical and social factors. A special national survey conducted in 1985 by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics showed that among a representative sample of 3,494 community-dwelling elderly persons aged greater than or equal to 65, 24% reported a fall in the past year; the rate was 16% among men and 31% among women. The majority of falls reported happened out of doors. Of those who fell 37% subsequently visited the emergency room. Analyses adjusted for age and sex showed that single persons, particularly women, living alone reported falls at a higher rate than their married counterparts. Analyses adjusted for age, sex and mobility level showed that frequency of social interaction was inversely related to reported falls. Use of sleeping pills, problems with vision, and mobility restrictions were associated with falls in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Advanced age (greater than 75 years) was associated with repeated falls that occurred both in the home and outdoors.",eng,0.7673493574151782
80012,M18236958,Determinants of resident autonomy in assisted living facilities: a review of the literature.,"Assisted living (AL) stresses the importance of resident autonomy in the provision of good quality care. Resident autonomy has been linked to better resident well-being, less reliance on supportive services, and greater participation in social activities. Little is known, however, about factors that foster resident autonomy in AL. This article reviews what is currently known about organizational determinants of resident autonomy in AL. The open-natural systems approach to organizational effectiveness, which views organizations in relation to their environment, provides a broad conceptual framework for this analysis. Factors that influence resident autonomy in AL are classified into two categories: (a) external environmental conditions (e.g., ownership status, chain membership, regulatory environment) and (b) internal organizational structures and processes (e.g., facility size, residents' functional ability, resident social resources, and staff work environment). Environmental conditions represent the most antecedent set of factors that influence resident autonomy, indirectly through their effects on internal organizational structures and processes. Internal organizational factors influence resident autonomy through their impact on policies that enable resident choice and control in the facility. More research is needed to better understand the complex mechanism(s) through which organizational factors influence resident autonomy.",eng,0.7664534311745739

In her book The Denial of Aging: Perpetual Youth, Eternal Life, and Other Dangerous Fantasies, Muriel Gillick proposes that the baby boomers will seek assisted living as an alternative to nursing home care. But what about that portion of the population not able to afford the high cost of private assisted living?

169000,M23718786,Living and dying: responsibility for end-of-life care in care homes without on-site nursing provision - a prospective study.,"The aim of the study was to describe the expectations and experiences of end-of-life care of older people resident in care homes, and how care home staff and the healthcare practitioners who visited the care home interpreted their role. A mixed-method design was used. The everyday experience of 121 residents from six care homes in the East of England were tracked; 63 residents, 30 care home staff with assorted roles and 19 National Health Service staff from different disciplines were interviewed. The review of care home notes demonstrated that residents had a wide range of healthcare problems. Length of time in the care homes, functional ability or episodes of ill-health were not necessarily meaningful indicators to staff that a resident was about to die. General Practitioner and district nursing services provided a frequent but episodic service to individual residents. There were two recurring themes that affected how staff engaged with the process of advance care planning with residents; 'talking about dying' and 'integrating living and dying'. All participants stated that they were committed to providing end-of-life care and supporting residents to die in the care home, if wanted. However, the process was complicated by an ongoing lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities in providing end-of-life care, doubts from care home and primary healthcare staff about their capacity to work together when residents' trajectories to death were unclear. The findings suggest that to support this population, there is a need for a pattern of working between health and care staff that can encourage review and discussion between multiple participants over sustained periods of time.

Knowledge was tested at baseline (T1), immediately after watching a Video on HFS (T2), and at 2-week follow-up (T3). A majority of the participants were Caucasian (n=9, 81.8%), and female (n=11, 91.7%); their mean age was 78years old (SD=12.7years). They had two chronic illnesses (n=1.8, SD=1.3), walked without help (n=7, 58.3%), and lived in a flat (n=10, 90.9%). Knowledge scores (percent correct) changed over time and were significantly different from T1 (46.7%) to T2 (59.2%, p=0.04) and from T1 (46.7%) to T3 (58.9%, p=0.04), but T2 and T3 (p=0.94) scores showed no difference. There is a need for educational HFS intervention programs aimed at this age group. This pilot successfully targeted active older adults living independently in sheltered housing complexes. Further fire safety research is needed with community dwelling older adults living in other types of housing.",eng,0.7579953496487254

This was a secondary data analysis using baseline data from a function-focused care intervention study including 171 residents from 4 assisted living facilities. Using structural equation modeling, we found that mood, satisfaction with staff and activities, and social support for exercise were directly associated with time spent in physical activity. Gender, cognition, depression, and comorbidities were indirectly associated with physical activity and accounted for 13% of the total variance in physical activity.

1750683,M1589665,Caregivers' experience of providing care for demented persons living at home.,"Caregivers providing home-care for demented persons answered a questionnaire concerning what was satisfactory or problematic when providing home-care. They were also asked what needs/wishes they had for themselves and for the demented persons. The findings reflected the impact of a functioning interpersonal relationship between the caregiver and the demented person and his family. The difficulties in handling problematic behaviour, and the necessity to be able to stimulate and provide activities for the demented were also emphasized. Moreover, the caregivers stressed their role as supporters of the patients' families, their need for more and better cooperation with the staff of the psychogeriatric clinic, and their need for training and supervision in how to manage their relationship with the demented person. Hence, it seems urgent to try to practise and evaluate systematic clinical guidance to provide knowledge and systematic supervision about how to manage demented persons in their own social context so that they can stay in their homes.",eng,0.7547600862391417

1962709,M1801956,Measuring hospital productivity and output: the omission of outpatient services.,"A common measure of hospital productivity is the ""cost per patient day"". This measure, however, has a variety of drawbacks, one of which is its omission of outpatient care in the measure of hospital output, since a patient day is merely a measure of the volume of patient services, while the cost of outpatient services is included in the input. This study uses information from the Statistics Canada Annual Return of Hospitals to examine the volume of inpatient, outpatient and total patient services, to separate inpatient and outpatient costs and to study hospital productivity from 1976 to 1987-88 using both inpatient cost per patient day and outpatient cost per outpatient visit. Operating costs for Canadian public hospitals, in constant dollars, increased by 38.5% from 1976 to 1987-88. A large increase in hospital costs is not cause for concern unless costs are rising faster than hospital output. There does seem to be some indication that this is the case. The productivity of public hospitals in Canada, measured by ""cost per patient day,"" has fallen by 19.8% from 1976 to 987-88. However, a major drawback to this measure of hospital productivity is that outpatient services were not included in the measure of output and therefore the productivity of hospitals is underestimated. When inpatient costs and services are separated from outpatient costs and services, inpatient services productivity as measured by inpatient cost per patient day still declines but only by 16.3%. On the other hand, outpatient cost per outpatient visit decreased by 2.3%, indicating an increase in productivity.",fre,0.6894941866836145

The deficiency at the level of manual rapidity is the most important element concerning the motive debility of mentally handicapped children. The tests show that there is no parallelism between the motive retardedness and the level of attainment of the corporal schema. In fact, the motor debility of 8 years old children is emphasized at the age of 10 with reference to normal children. On the other hand, if, at the age of 8, the mentally handicapped children have a lag of the corporal schema acquisition, these children have nearly overcome their retardedness at the age of 10. Therefore one can conclude that the motor retardedness of the slightly mentally handicapped children is not essentially due to a deficiency of the corporal schema integration.",ger,0.6867710549047705

From this point of view, the vectorial dose quantities introduced in part I of this paper are reviewed, their correlations are examined as well as their dependences on different influencing quantities e.g. on the rotational position of the wedge filter with the central ray as an axis of rotation. The vectorial description of dose distribution used in this paper, additionally offers information on the total effect upon the inclination of isodose surfaces or curves respectively, caused either simultaneously by different influences (simultaneous effect) or in temporal succession by separate influences (succession effect). The correlations observed can be verified diagrammatically or dosimetrically using simple practical examples.

1363119,M1201830,[Occupational therapeutic measures before and after surgical correction of hands with congenital malformations].,"The task of the occupational therapist following surgical procedures on deformed hands is discussed. In the child with congenital malformations, we must not only be concerned with treatment of the deformity but we must be concerned about the psychic problems which can develop following prolonged hospitalization or overprotection. One must be keenly observant to detect these problems early. Preoperative testing utilizing a standardized gripping test is carried out by the occupational therapist. The necessity for this is demonstrated by the example of the radial clubhand. In this way complications such as correction of clubhand in the face of a stiff elbow or pollicisation in the presence of inadequate clubhand correction can thus be avoided. After operation training in the new functions is begun as early as possible; preferably with individual supervision. Daily repetative and progressive exercises should result in maximum utilization of gripping ability provided by the operative procedure. The treatment program also includes the adaptation of clothing, the production of appliances and splints, in co-operation with the orthopedic technician, as well as specially designed functional exercises. All these factors are as important as the operative procedure itself in contributing to maximum benifit. All essential findings and their variations must be written down. Also the photographic documentation of the functions is the job of the occupational therapist. Sufficient time should be allowed prior to discharge to inform the parents about the newly acquired functions and the use of the applicances. The maintenance and further development of the newly acquired functions is insured through the continued ambulatory supervision by the doctor and the occupational therapist. The occupational therapist thus has a significant job as a member of the team in a special unit for children with congenital malformations.",ger,0.6811782158201617
754689,M579586,A reflection on the oxygen diffusion of the terminal villus of the human placenta (author's transl).,"By using a simple model, transformed to cartesian coordinates, we examined the behavior of the fetal and maternal oxygen partial pressure on the terminal villus of the human placenta during a constant arteriovenous oxygen difference. For this purpose we divided the flow length of the cotyledon in central and a peripheral part. We found that the oxygen exchange takes place at a lower utero-umbilical oxygen pressure gradient it the reduction of the maternal blood flow velocity amounts to 30% of the normal value and if the diffusion distance is doubled. However under these circumstances a sufficient the oxygen supply of the fetal organism. This is the case with the total flow length of a single cotyledon, but some of the terminal villi in the periphery of the cotyledon, could receive at the same time a diminished oxygen supply leading to degenerative cell changes. At a progression of these morphological changes or during labor the oxygen transport can get insufficient.",ger,0.6810297517364128

1291462,M1130131,Comparison between Wilson's thoracic leads and the telemetrically transmitted lead CM6 in patients with heart diseases during exertion.,"In 76 patients suffering from heart diseases and 19 healthy men simultaneously the chest leads V(2), V(4) and V(5) were recorded and the bipolar lead CM(6) (Manubrium sterni-Apex cordis, 6th intercostal space) transmitted telemetrically during increasing exercise load on the bicycle ergometer. The lead CM(6) was most similar to chest lead V(5) with regard to R/S-ratio, ST-depression, form and amplitude of the T-wave, QX-QT-ratio and ST-elevation. ST-depressions of V(5) were found nearly without exception in CM(6), mostly more pronounced. Ascending ST-depressions are more frequent in CM(6) than in V(5), in single patients also ST-depressions with horizontal or downward slope. ST-elevations registrated in V(2) and V(4) are not reliably reproduced in CM(6). It is concluded that the wireless transmission of the bipolar chest lead CM(6) is sufficient for the diagnosis of coronary insufficiency during exercise,",ger,0.6795815997135701

Its effect on insemination results.,"Fifty gilts and 33 old sows which exhibited oestrous after bio-engineering treatment were electrically stimulated during insemination, using an A.C. mains-connected unit. The average voltages applied were 3.7 volt for gilts and between 2.5 and 2.8 volt for the old sows. The current was applied rectally, and the responsiveness differed individually. The treated animals then were compared to unstimulated controls, and the achievement in terms of born piglets was 1.18 more for gilts and 1.20 more for the old sows. Those better results were attributed to electric acceleration of sperm transport.",ger,0.6772708790741683
