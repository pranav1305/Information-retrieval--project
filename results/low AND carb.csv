Slaughter yield, amount of breast meat, and abdominal fat were determined at 6 wk of age in all groups and at a body weight of 2,360 g for males and 1,965 g for females in the low- and normal-temperature groups, and at 8 wk in the high-temperature groups. Temperature, genotype, and sex influenced both absolute and relative weights of carcass, breast meat, and abdominal fat. Temperature had a negative effect on breast meat yield. Males were affected more by high temperature than females. A significant interaction between temperature and sex for breast meat yield was caused by a low yield for males at the high temperature. A similar interaction for proportion of abdominal fat was caused by a high fat content in males reared at the high temperature. Slaughter yield and especially yield of breast meat were highest in FC chickens in all comparisons.",eng,0.7429341665224013

104772,M28295777,Can LDL cholesterol be too low? Possible risks of extremely low levels.,"Following the continuous accumulation of evidence supporting the beneficial role of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, therapeutic possibilities now exist to lower LDL-C to very low levels, similar to or even lower than those seen in newborns and nonhuman species. In addition to the important task of evaluating potential side effects of such treatments, the question arises whether extremely low LDL-C levels per se may provoke adverse effects in humans. In this review, we summarize information from studies of human cellular and organ physiology, phenotypic characterization of rare genetic diseases of lipid metabolism, and experience from clinical trials. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of the robustness of the regulatory systems that maintain balanced fluxes and levels of cholesterol at both cellular and organismal levels. Even at extremely low LDL-C levels, critical capacities of steroid hormone and bile acid production are preserved, and the presence of a cholesterol blood-brain barrier protects cells in the central nervous system. Apparent relationships sometimes reported between less pronounced low LDL-C levels and disease states such as cancer, depression, infectious disease and others can generally be explained as secondary phenomena. Drug-related side effects including an increased propensity for development of type 2 diabetes occur during statin treatment, whilst further evaluation of more potent LDL-lowering treatments such as PCSK9 inhibitors is needed. Experience from the recently reported and ongoing large event-driven trials are of great interest, and further evaluation including careful analysis of cognitive functions will be important.",eng,0.7362946627630602

Results of an analysis in which three different age groups (means = 15, 17, and 28 months) were compared indicated a nonsignificant interaction between age and blood pressure for heart weight and between age and blood pressure for heart/body weight ratios. Heart weight and heart/body weight ratios were significantly higher for the high than for the low BP mice at all ages with one exception; heart weights did not differ between the two lines at mean age 28 months. It was concluded that high blood pressure mice do not exhibit cardiac hypertrophy in the strictest sense of a disproportionately greater increase in heart/body weight ratios across the life span than low blood pressure for this particular stock.",eng,0.7203146391400034
1895329,M1734388,Nutrient adequacy of low fat intakes for children: the Bogalusa Heart Study.,"Nutritional adequacy is important when diets and dietary alterations are recommended for children. Concern is expressed that low fat intakes may have deleterious effects on growth and development and may be deficient in total calories and essential nutrients. In a study of the effect of variation in percent fat in the diet, a sample of 871 ten-year-olds was stratified according to four different fat intakes: less than 30% of total kilocalories (kcal), 30% to 35% kcal, 35% to 40% kcal, and greater than 40% kcal. The race/sex distribution was similar within each fat intake group. Fourteen percent of the sample had fat intakes less than 30% of total calories. The amount of calories from breakfast, dinner, and snacks was higher in the children with fat intakes greater than 40% of total calories than those with lower fat intakes. The energy intake of all race/sex groups fell within the recommended range. The low fat intake group was eating 25% less calories than the high fat intake group (1800 kcal vs 2400 kcal). The percentage of calories from carbohydrate, specifically sugar, was greater in the low fat intake group compared with the high fat intake group. Percentage of calories from protein was approximately 13% for all groups. Fiber and starch were the same across all fat intakes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",eng,0.7192243993293005

Micronutrient intakes of 553 Dutch (sub-) elite athletes were assessed using web-based 24-h dietary recalls with accompanying nutritional supplement questionnaires. In the majority of both users and non-users of dietary supplements, vitamin D intake was below the estimated average requirement (AR) if supplements were not included in the analysis. Including dietary supplements improved vitamin D intake, but still a part of the athletes, both men and women, reported an intake below the AR. Non-users of dietary supplements were particularly at risk for low intakes of vitamins B1, B2, B3 and vitamins A, C and selenium. Mean iron intake was reported below the AR in a substantial group of women, both users and non-users. The use of sport nutrition products contributed only slightly to micronutrient intake. A small prevalence of athletes using dietary supplements showed intakes of some micronutrients above the Upper Level. In conclusion, both users and non-users of nutritional supplements reported inadequate intake of micronutrients. For most micronutrients, use of nutritional supplements does not completely compensate for intakes below AR. Athletes should consider making better food choices and the daily use of a low-dosed multivitamin supplement.",eng,0.7187452525557241

In a longitudinal study PRA was determined in 9 patients before the start of lithium treatment and at intervals during 3 months of treatment. The activity was increased significantly above pretreatment values on day 8 of the treatment; thereafter it fell to pretreatment values. In a transversal study 18 patients given lithium treatment for 2-20 years were compared with 11 control persons. PRA did not differ significantly between the two groups. The results indicate that PRA rises transiently shortly after start of lithium treatment and thereafter falls to pretreatment values where it remains even under prolonged lithium administration.,ger,0.5658448587620138

1981602,M1820871,Fluoride bioavailability from sodium fluoride alone or in association with different calcium salts.,Fluoride pharmacokinetics were studied in twelve healthy subjects after oral administration of one tablet of osteofluor-containing 25 mg of sodium fluoride alone or associated with different calcium salts (500 mg Ca element) given as microcrystalline hydroxyapatite compound or powdered tri-calcium phosphate. Fluoride was measured in plasma and urine with a specific electrode and fluoride bioavailability from the three drugs was compared. Calcium absorption after oral load was assessed by measuring variations from the fasting state of plasma calcium and parathyroid hormone and of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio. The bioavailability of fluoride is significantly decreased by the association to sodium fluoride of hydroxyapatite but not of tri-calcium phosphate. Calcium absorption seems greater after administration of hydroxyapatite compound. The decrease of the fluoride bioavailability is probably dependent on the capacity of calcium absorption from the calcium salts. The association of calcium to fluoride is absolutely required for treatment of osteoporosis. The microcrystalline hydroxyapatite compound seems preferable in view of its greater calcium absorption and of its limited decrease in fluoride bioavailability.,fre,0.5493453314272072

The deficiency at the level of manual rapidity is the most important element concerning the motive debility of mentally handicapped children. The tests show that there is no parallelism between the motive retardedness and the level of attainment of the corporal schema. In fact, the motor debility of 8 years old children is emphasized at the age of 10 with reference to normal children. On the other hand, if, at the age of 8, the mentally handicapped children have a lag of the corporal schema acquisition, these children have nearly overcome their retardedness at the age of 10. Therefore one can conclude that the motor retardedness of the slightly mentally handicapped children is not essentially due to a deficiency of the corporal schema integration.",ger,0.5481638234096057

During the reaction of mercaptanes, e.g. cysteine, homocysteine, cysteamine, with dansyl chloride, the corresponding disulfides are formed and dansyl chloride is reduced to 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene 1-sulfinic acid. This reaction is so rapid that the normal dansylation can take place only after complete oxidation of all SH-compounds. Therefore only the dansyl derivatives of the corresponding disulfides are formed during normal dansylation of SH-compounds. If different SH-compounds are present in the reaction mixture mixed disulfides are formed as well. These can be separated by microchromatography on 3 X 3 cm micropolyamide sheets. Dependent on the concentration of dansyl chloride, 6 or even 15 different dansylated disulfides are formed from three different SH-compounds so that interpretation of these chromatograms is difficult.

1611043,M1449986,Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines.,"Unexpected results suggesting decreased survival when compared with standard titre vaccine administered at 9 months of age have been found in some field studies evaluating the performance of high titre measles vaccine. Analytical difficulties have arisen because the studies were not specifically designed to measure survival. Nonetheless, careful analysis of the results from all of the high titre vaccine trials showed decreased survival of high titre vaccine recipients, in areas with high background mortality rates, compared with recipients of standard measles vaccines at 9 months. No systematic biases could be found in the studies to explain these differences. Statistical analysis of these data suggested that the findings were unlikely to be attributable to chance alone. The panel recommended that high titre measles vaccine derived from the original Edmonston measles vaccine isolate should no longer be recommended for use in immunization programmes. Further post-licensure field studies of new measles vaccines should take into account the results of these studies. Additional detailed epidemiological studies in populations that have received high titre vaccines and their controls were encouraged.",fre,0.5350088764173802

366749,M185717,[Validity of bronchial flow measurement by Wright's air flowmeter. Comparison with maximal expiratory volume in a second].,"The validity of measurement of bronchial air flow, using Wright's air flow meter, was studied comparing the maximum air flow thus obtained with the maximum expiratory volume in one second, used as unit of reference. During a first stage, the reproducibility of the test was determined this was excellent, 3.26% for the maximal flow rate and 2.48% for the maximum volume expired in one second. During a second stage were drawn up correlations between the two tests which were very narrow: O.971 in healthy sbjects, 0.919 in sick patients. The Wright flow meter is a strong, reliable and inexpensive instrument and will thus be very useful in the daily assessment of bronchiolar constriction at the bed side, and in the routine detection of obstructive syndromes.",fre,0.534465020394096

The detected products are TRH-3H or synthetic TRH. The HPLC analysis is performed on a microparticulate (10 mu) silica gel chromatographic column with CH3CN/0,01 M NH4OAc, at pH 6 (30/70) (V/V). This technique provides a good separation of TRH and the other products of degradation. In our experimental conditions, the human plasma degrades 62.5 +/- 5% of of TRH in 60 mn; very similar results are obtained with thin layer chromatography.",fre,0.5307018890511385
