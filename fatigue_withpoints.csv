6,6,1919720,M1758789,Activity and post-polio fatigue.,Fatigue was studied in 12 subjects with post-polio sequelae (PPS). Results of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) demonstrated a mean score of 4.8 +/- 1.6 (non-disabled scores = 2.3 +/- 0.7). The Human Activity Profile (HAP) was not sensitive enough to measure fatigue. Fifty percent of subjects scored below the first percentile based on age and sex matched norms. The Activity Record (ACTRE) results revealed that subjects spent 5% of their time resting and 1% in planning or preparation activities. Fatigue peaked in the late morning or early afternoon and was relieved by rest periods. Use of energy conservation and work simplification skills along with frequent rest periods was suggested as a possible method for managing PPS fatigue.,eng,0.8534171618465846,5

11,11,125905,M28186393,Chronic fatigue in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-Hypermobile type.,"Chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health-related quality of life in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. There is overlap in the symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. A proportion of those with CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified. The evaluation of chronic fatigue in EDS needs to include a careful clinical examination and laboratory testing to exclude common causes of fatigue including anemia, hypothyroidisim, and chronic infection, as well as dysfunction of major physiological or organ systems. Other problems that commonly contribute to fatigue in EDS include sleep disorders, chronic pain, deconditioning, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunction, psychological issues, and nutritional deficiencies. While there is no specific pharmacological treatment for fatigue, many medications are effective for specific symptoms (such as headache, menstrual dysfunction, or myalgia) and for co-morbid conditions that result in fatigue, including orthostatic intolerance and insomnia. Comprehensive treatment of fatigue needs to also evaluate for biomechanical problems that are common in EDS, and usually involves skilled physical therapy and attention to methods to prevent deconditioning. In addition to managing specific symptoms, treatment of fatigue in EDS also needs to focus on maintaining function and providing social, physical, and nutritional support, as well as providing on-going medical evaluation of new problems and review of new evidence about proposed treatments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",eng,0.8290034613510392,5

The role played by respiratory muscle fatigue in exercise limitation and in acute respiratory failure is still unclear. The electromyogram often reflects contractions beyond the fatigue threshold, but overt force failure has been only rarely demonstrated under these circumstances. Hypercapnic ventilatory failure may possibly not result from fatigue, but rather from an adaptation of the respiratory system for avoiding fatigue. The treatment of fatigue comprises respiratory muscle support by adequate nutrition and oxygen delivery, and if needed respiratory muscle rest by mechanical ventilation.",fre,0.6237698600913896,3

This aspect has not been taken into consideration sufficiently yet in theory of stress. I like to stress once more that it is the excessive, too intensive stress reaction which is leading to psychic disturbances as well as functional disturbances. Stress which does not exceed a certain extent has to be considered physiologically: the organism needs it as stimulans to obtain its functions: it could not survive without this stimulans. The situation only becomes risky if the stress factors are causing pathogenous disturbances. This situation has been named ""dis-stress"" by Selye. The best guarantees to avoid ""dis-stress"" as well as psychic stress-disorders are changing of attitude of life, compensation of overstrain by sensible recreational activities, going in for sport, engagement for human and social environmental factors as well as a harmonic family-life and a conception of life in the sense of imperturbability and tolerance.",ger,0.6080605006139151,1

Moreover, there was a significant reduction of blood monocytes to 30% (p less than 0.001). A reduced lymphocyte proliferation induced by antigens or mitogens was found in parallel. Prior to treatment, monocyte-macrophage activation in rheumatoid arthritis was signified by an increased expression of HLA-class II antigens and the CD14 antigen, and by an increased production of neopterin and interleukin-1.

The main features of these fractues, which occurred in previously intact bones, are reviewed. The role of previous muscle imbalance, or metabolic disturbance, (by age or in pregnancy) is discussed. Good results were obtained by simple immobilization. Surgery may be indicated in the two situations: 1. To eliminate the possibility of a bone tumour by biopsy and, 2.

Its incidence is more than 1 percent in the population as a whole. It exists in snorers. Both snoring and SOAS are linked to the presence of abnormalities (congenital or acquired) of the upper respiratory tract. The nocturnal cardiovascular consequences of SOAS are directly linked to apnea. Bradycardia occurs during apnea and tachycardia when ventilation restarts. Paroxysmal nocturnal hypertension is a constant feature. Even in individuals who are normotensive during the day, each restarting of ventilation is accompanied by peaking of blood pressure. The pulmonary artery pressure curve follows that of systemic blood pressure. Complications begin when SOAS has been present for several years: 1) Chronic: permanent systemic hypertension is common (56 percent of SOAS). It is often refractory to antihypertensive treatment. 2) Acute: the onset of myocardial infarction and of cerebrovascular accidents explains the heavy mortality of SOAS (37 percent at 8 years in untreated individuals with a number of episodes of apnea exceeding 20 per hour of sleep). Other acute complications are less common: acute pulmonary edema, nocturnal sudden death. These events may be prevented by treatment suppressing apnea: actuarial survival curves are then superimposable upon those of the population as a whole.

While the initiating event in the majority of patients is a pyrexial illness, possibly due to enterovirus infection, evidence of persisting infection or inflammatory changes in muscle and/or brain remain unconvincing. CFS patients display a definite reduced aerobic work capacity compared to normal control subjects, but this may reflect a state of deconditioning resulting from prolonged physical inactivity. They also have an altered perception of their level of exertion and premorbid fitness. The characteristic fluctuation in symptoms, with periods of relapses and partial remissions, may indicate that some central disorder of sensory perception is operational. It may be that a primary sleep disorder results in a reduced sensory threshold for afferent stimuli from muscle. This could well account for many of the subjective symptoms which patients experience.

Evidence supports persistent viral infection in a small percentage of CFS patients. Immunologic abnormalities do exist in CFS, which indicate the presence of immune activation in CFS patients. Although abnormal muscle biopsies have been found in some patients with CFS, strength and endurance appear normal, but perception of exertion may be abnormal. Patients with chronic fatigue have a high incidence of premorbid and concurrent psychiatric disorders, and on physical examination many often have reproducible tender points similar to fibromyalgic patients. Clinical evaluation should rule out other potential causes of fatigue, but elaborate diagnostic tests are seldom required. Presently, no specific treatment exists for CFS.

70,43,335180,M153178,Evolution de la compliance série du muscle isolé en fonction de la fatigue.,"Frog sartorius muscles are stretched at rest and during tetanic contractions, and series-compliance of normal muscle is compared to that of a fatigued one. The series-compliance is calculated from the parallel compliance and the active one. The compliance decreases when the tension increases and becomes quite constant for the highest levels of tension. These results are discussed on the basis of the sliding filaments theory.",fre,0.5959769739334609,2
71,45,1280022,M1118677,Atemmechanik und Belastungsdyspnoe bei Silikose,"Mechanics of breathing as studied in patients with different stages of silicosis in rest and during exercise show the following: dynamic compliance and work against elastic and viscous resistances could not be found to be decisive indices of exertion dyspnea. Evidence of exertion dyspnea could only be achieved by means of the ration VT/PT (VT equals tidal volume, PT equals tidal esophageal pressure). Exertion dyspnea was observed at less than 0,081 VT per cm H20 PT. In accordance with Campbell and Howell, dyspnea is seen as an inappropriateness between ventilation and pressure needed.",ger,0.5953416318973245,1

76,59,1765124,M1604112,Syndrome parkinsonien familial avec athymhormie et hypoventilation.,"Five cases of parkinsonism with athymhormia observed in a single family are reported. Death caused by central respiratory disorders occurred after 6 to 8 years of progressive course. In 2 cases with autopsy, there was a severe neuronal loss predominant in the substantia nigra. Other brain stem nuclei (locus coeruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, nucleus of the tractus solitarius) were involved, as well as the striatum, pallidum and frontal cortex. No Lewy body was seen. In the surviving patient, positron emission tomography demonstrated, 4 years after the onset, a bilateral frontal hypometabolism. This disease is a rare variety of familial parkinsonism of dominant inheritance, already reported in 2 Canadian families by Perry et al. (1975) and Purdy et al. (1978) and in a family of West Virginia by Roy et al. (1988). The respiratory disorders can be explained by the involvement of the dorsal medullary nuclei. The peculiar neuropsychological disorder and motor slowing are best accounted for by the functional impairment of both motor and limbic striato-pallido-thalamo-frontal loops.",fre,0.5802838691003156,1
