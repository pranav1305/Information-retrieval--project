In addition, it is however necessary to improve the structural and functional facilities and possibilities within the framework of the hospital finance law. This includes early, supraregional guidance in cases of hospital planning as well as cooperation in hygiene committees.

They found that 57% of the total net charge of $150,489 had been paid within 180 days. This rate can be compared with an average inpatient collection rate of 85% at 180 days. Seven factors were found to account for the collection rate variation, making up 38.4% of the total variation. Age, gender, primary diagnosis, season of visit, time of arrival, and residence were not found to be main contributors. Insufficient collection rates may be an indication that EDs increasingly are becoming a financial risk to hospitals. The hospital's collection experience will become more important as an indicator of financial risk if the costs of operating EDs continue to escalate and collection rates do not improve. Both the costs of providing a service and the amount of the charge actually collected are valid concerns to those operating EDs.",eng,0.6134608282558347

Hospitalization may be necessary for adequate observation, proper preparation for diagnostic studies, or safe treatment. Simple traumatic injuries or infections can usually be treated effectively without hospitalization if sound surgical principles are observed.

Patients' records were analysed with respect to predisposing factors, inpatient management, postoperative analgesia, hospital stay and post-management complications. One hundred and nineteen patients had haemorrhoidectomy (low ligation combined with an anal stretch). Of these, 1.6% developed urinary retention and 4.2% bled postoperatively but did not require surgical intervention. Ten patients were found to have tight anal canals post surgery and required outpatient anal dilatation. In no case was dilatation necessary for more than 3 months. Three patients required a therapeutic course of antibiotics. Of the 119 patients, 60 required narcotic analgesia for less than 24 hours. Hospital stay was 1-4 nights.",eng,0.6036334652772178

This paper prospectively reviews the results of management of 205 orthopaedic and trauma patients who passed through such a unit over a 2-year period. The unit was shown to provide effective and safe care for a group of particularly high-risk patients for whom care on a routine ward at times would be insufficient and for whom care on an intensive care unit is unnecessarily expensive and occasionally unavailable. The high-dependency unit as described in this paper represents an efficient use of resources for this group of patients.,eng,0.5972837873411269

One hundred and ten cases were reviewed (8.4% of all inpatients); median age 73 years (range 26-99), 59 female. Fifty-five percent were medical patients (general or geriatric) and 16% were general surgical. Six remained inpatients after 6 months. Sixteen died, of whom 10 had macrovascular disease. Median length of stay was 22 days (2-300), significantly above the district average in all specialties (< 10 days). Of 15 patients with foot problems, 5 died and 3 had major amputations. Only 23% of all patients had documented evidence of screening for diabetic complications. The discharge diagnoses failed to acknowledge diabetes in 54 cases (including 10 deaths). Only 10% had formal advice from the diabetes team and subsequent audit revealed that metabolic management was commonly suboptimal in non-physician units. These data suggest that inpatient diabetes is costly and carries a high mortality. The incidence is substantially underestimated by conventional episode statistics. The evidence from this cohort of diabetic inpatients suggests that improved communication and recognition of the importance of diabetes could usefully contribute to the quality of care achieved.",eng,0.596723244593368

Given the increased interest in pediatric prehospital research, there is a need to identify specific research priorities that incorporate the perspective of prehospital providers and other emergency medical services (EMS) stakeholders.!##!Objectives!#!To develop a list of specific research priorities that is relevant, specific, and important to the practice of pediatric prehospital care.!##!Methods!#!Three independent committees of EMS providers and researchers were recruited. Each committee developed a list of research topics. These topics were collated and used to initiate a modified Delphi process for developing consensus on a list of research priorities. Participants were the committee members. Topics approved by 80% were retained as research priorities. Topics that were rejected by more than 50% were eliminated. The remaining topics were modified and included on subsequent surveys. Each survey allowed respondents to add additional topics. The surveys were continued until all topics were either successfully retained or rejected and no new topics were suggested.!##!Results!#!Fifty topics were identified by the three independent committees. These topics were included on the initial electronic survey. There were 5 subsequent surveys. At the completion of the final survey a total of 29 research priorities were identified. These research priorities covered the following study areas: airway management, asthma, cardiac arrest, pain, patient-family interaction, resource utilization, seizure, sepsis, spinal immobilization, toxicology, trauma, training and competency, and vascular access. The research priorities were very specific. For example, under airway the priorities were: ""identify the optimal device for effectively managing the airway in the prehospital setting"" and ""identify the optimal airway management device for specific disease processes.""!##!Conclusion!#!This project developed a list of relevant, specific, and important research priorities for pediatric prehospital care. Some similarities exist between this project and prior research agendas but this list represents a current, more specific research agenda and reflects the opinions of working EMS providers, researchers, and leaders.!##!Key words!#!emergency medical technician; research; emergency medical services; priorities.",eng,0.609541018378515

Since the majority of deaths from coronary heart disease occur early and outside the hospital, the importance of the prehospital phase is emphasized. The delay in this period, which is very dangerous for the patient, should be reduced and mobile coronary care units (MCCU's) are one possibility to reduce the rate of sudden coronary death. Different systems of MCCU's are discussed: (1) those based on a hospital coronary care unit, usually accompanied by a nurse and/or a doctor and (2) those integrated into an already existing decentralized emergency system (e.g. fire department) run by paramedics. Although long-term survival of patients resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation is not so good, the results of many of these units are remarkable.",eng,0.5977624035508583
