1919720,M1758789,Activity and post-polio fatigue.,Fatigue was studied in 12 subjects with post-polio sequelae (PPS). Results of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) demonstrated a mean score of 4.8 +/- 1.6 (non-disabled scores = 2.3 +/- 0.7). The Human Activity Profile (HAP) was not sensitive enough to measure fatigue. Fifty percent of subjects scored below the first percentile based on age and sex matched norms. The Activity Record (ACTRE) results revealed that subjects spent 5% of their time resting and 1% in planning or preparation activities. Fatigue peaked in the late morning or early afternoon and was relieved by rest periods. Use of energy conservation and work simplification skills along with frequent rest periods was suggested as a possible method for managing PPS fatigue.,eng,0.8534171618465846

125905,M28186393,Chronic fatigue in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-Hypermobile type.,"Chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health-related quality of life in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. There is overlap in the symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. A proportion of those with CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified. The evaluation of chronic fatigue in EDS needs to include a careful clinical examination and laboratory testing to exclude common causes of fatigue including anemia, hypothyroidisim, and chronic infection, as well as dysfunction of major physiological or organ systems. Other problems that commonly contribute to fatigue in EDS include sleep disorders, chronic pain, deconditioning, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunction, psychological issues, and nutritional deficiencies. While there is no specific pharmacological treatment for fatigue, many medications are effective for specific symptoms (such as headache, menstrual dysfunction, or myalgia) and for co-morbid conditions that result in fatigue, including orthostatic intolerance and insomnia. Comprehensive treatment of fatigue needs to also evaluate for biomechanical problems that are common in EDS, and usually involves skilled physical therapy and attention to methods to prevent deconditioning. In addition to managing specific symptoms, treatment of fatigue in EDS also needs to focus on maintaining function and providing social, physical, and nutritional support, as well as providing on-going medical evaluation of new problems and review of new evidence about proposed treatments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",eng,0.8290034613510392

1707317,M1546280,Fatigue des muscles respiratoires.,"Respiratory muscle fatigue is induced experimentally by adding high external resistances to breathing. The role played by respiratory muscle fatigue in exercise limitation and in acute respiratory failure is still unclear. The electromyogram often reflects contractions beyond the fatigue threshold, but overt force failure has been only rarely demonstrated under these circumstances. Hypercapnic ventilatory failure may possibly not result from fatigue, but rather from an adaptation of the respiratory system for avoiding fatigue. The treatment of fatigue comprises respiratory muscle support by adequate nutrition and oxygen delivery, and if needed respiratory muscle rest by mechanical ventilation.",fre,0.6237698600913908

207589,M23580,Psychische Krankheit und Stress.,"Main purpose of my presentation was to give a review on the effects of the stress-factors on the psyche. This aspect has not been taken into consideration sufficiently yet in theory of stress. I like to stress once more that it is the excessive, too intensive stress reaction which is leading to psychic disturbances as well as functional disturbances. Stress which does not exceed a certain extent has to be considered physiologically: the organism needs it as stimulans to obtain its functions: it could not survive without this stimulans. The situation only becomes risky if the stress factors are causing pathogenous disturbances. This situation has been named ""dis-stress"" by Selye. The best guarantees to avoid ""dis-stress"" as well as psychic stress-disorders are changing of attitude of life, compensation of overstrain by sensible recreational activities, going in for sport, engagement for human and social environmental factors as well as a harmonic family-life and a conception of life in the sense of imperturbability and tolerance.",ger,0.6080605006139197

A depletion of CD4+ T-cells down to 8% of the origin level (p less than 0.0001) followed the antibody application. Moreover, there was a significant reduction of blood monocytes to 30% (p less than 0.001). A reduced lymphocyte proliferation induced by antigens or mitogens was found in parallel. Prior to treatment, monocyte-macrophage activation in rheumatoid arthritis was signified by an increased expression of HLA-class II antigens and the CD14 antigen, and by an increased production of neopterin and interleukin-1. Anti-CD4 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of elevated levels of neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin in serum as well as IL-1 production in vitro.",ger,0.6071957220505853

In two patients, they presented in metatarsal bones; others were in the lower end of the tibia, in the shaft of the fibula, in the patella, at the upper end of the fibula, in the shaft to the tibia and in the neck of the femur. The main features of these fractues, which occurred in previously intact bones, are reviewed. The role of previous muscle imbalance, or metabolic disturbance, (by age or in pregnancy) is discussed. Good results were obtained by simple immobilization. Surgery may be indicated in the two situations: 1. To eliminate the possibility of a bone tumour by biopsy and, 2. For internal fixation in special sites such as the femoral neck to avoid coxa vara or when healing is very slow, as occurs particularly in the femoral shaft.",fre,0.6051115738181616

The contents of Ca, Na+ and hydroxyproline increase. There is also an increased urinary excretion of adrenaline and especially noradrenaline. With simultaneous noise stress, these changes are even greater. The magnitude of the changes increases with the degree of Mg-deficiency. The changes in the contents of Na+, K+, Ca, Mg and hydroxyproline correlate with the excretion of noradrenaline. The increase in the collagen content can be verified by electron microscopy, and it is due to a stimulation of the fibrocytes.",ger,0.600275354417717

Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution at rest and during exercise. In 47 patients out of these 91 PCP was found to be normal and did not exceed 20 mm Hg during exercise, the remaining 44 patients developed pathologically raised PCP during exercise. The average cardiac output was normal at rest und during exercise. Those pathological PCP during exercise, which could be demonstrated in nearly 50% of all investigated hypertensive patients, reflect an elevation of left ventricular filling pressure, the reasons of which are briefly discussed.",ger,0.6000448347668818

The characteristics of the graph obtained form the measurement system were compared to the graphs of uninjured knee extensor muscles.

Its incidence is more than 1 percent in the population as a whole. It exists in snorers. Both snoring and SOAS are linked to the presence of abnormalities (congenital or acquired) of the upper respiratory tract. The nocturnal cardiovascular consequences of SOAS are directly linked to apnea. Bradycardia occurs during apnea and tachycardia when ventilation restarts. Paroxysmal nocturnal hypertension is a constant feature. Even in individuals who are normotensive during the day, each restarting of ventilation is accompanied by peaking of blood pressure. The pulmonary artery pressure curve follows that of systemic blood pressure. Complications begin when SOAS has been present for several years: 1) Chronic: permanent systemic hypertension is common (56 percent of SOAS). It is often refractory to antihypertensive treatment. 2) Acute: the onset of myocardial infarction and of cerebrovascular accidents explains the heavy mortality of SOAS (37 percent at 8 years in untreated individuals with a number of episodes of apnea exceeding 20 per hour of sleep). Other acute complications are less common: acute pulmonary edema, nocturnal sudden death. These events may be prevented by treatment suppressing apnea: actuarial survival curves are then superimposable upon those of the population as a whole.
