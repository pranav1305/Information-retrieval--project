1631633,M1470585,"Effects of low, normal, and high temperatures on slaughter yield of broilers from lines selected for high weight gain, favorable feed conversion, and high or low fat content.","Male and female broiler chicks from five different broiler crosses (WI = Israeli chicks selected for increased body weight; LF and HF = Israeli chicks selected for low and high abdominal fat, respectively; FC and WN = Dutch chicks selected for improved feed conversion and increased body weight, respectively) were raised at low, normal, or high temperature. Slaughter yield, amount of breast meat, and abdominal fat were determined at 6 wk of age in all groups and at a body weight of 2,360 g for males and 1,965 g for females in the low- and normal-temperature groups, and at 8 wk in the high-temperature groups. Temperature, genotype, and sex influenced both absolute and relative weights of carcass, breast meat, and abdominal fat. Temperature had a negative effect on breast meat yield. Males were affected more by high temperature than females. A significant interaction between temperature and sex for breast meat yield was caused by a low yield for males at the high temperature. A similar interaction for proportion of abdominal fat was caused by a high fat content in males reared at the high temperature. Slaughter yield and especially yield of breast meat were highest in FC chickens in all comparisons.",eng,0.7235678274560603

Results of an analysis in which three different age groups (means = 15, 17, and 28 months) were compared indicated a nonsignificant interaction between age and blood pressure for heart weight and between age and blood pressure for heart/body weight ratios. Heart weight and heart/body weight ratios were significantly higher for the high than for the low BP mice at all ages with one exception; heart weights did not differ between the two lines at mean age 28 months. It was concluded that high blood pressure mice do not exhibit cardiac hypertrophy in the strictest sense of a disproportionately greater increase in heart/body weight ratios across the life span than low blood pressure for this particular stock.",eng,0.7196926030805992

104772,M28295777,Can LDL cholesterol be too low? Possible risks of extremely low levels.,"Following the continuous accumulation of evidence supporting the beneficial role of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, therapeutic possibilities now exist to lower LDL-C to very low levels, similar to or even lower than those seen in newborns and nonhuman species. In addition to the important task of evaluating potential side effects of such treatments, the question arises whether extremely low LDL-C levels per se may provoke adverse effects in humans. In this review, we summarize information from studies of human cellular and organ physiology, phenotypic characterization of rare genetic diseases of lipid metabolism, and experience from clinical trials. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of the robustness of the regulatory systems that maintain balanced fluxes and levels of cholesterol at both cellular and organismal levels. Even at extremely low LDL-C levels, critical capacities of steroid hormone and bile acid production are preserved, and the presence of a cholesterol blood-brain barrier protects cells in the central nervous system. Apparent relationships sometimes reported between less pronounced low LDL-C levels and disease states such as cancer, depression, infectious disease and others can generally be explained as secondary phenomena. Drug-related side effects including an increased propensity for development of type 2 diabetes occur during statin treatment, whilst further evaluation of more potent LDL-lowering treatments such as PCSK9 inhibitors is needed. Experience from the recently reported and ongoing large event-driven trials are of great interest, and further evaluation including careful analysis of cognitive functions will be important.",eng,0.7098793389523234

The diet was well tolerated, and mean weight loss was 2.49 kg/week during the 4-week period. Nitrogen excretion diminished in all patients during the period of treatment, but nitrogen balance remained slightly negative in most patients, mean daily deficit being 1.3 g N/day at the end of the study. The rate at which nitrogen was loss declined in a biphasic fashion, a slower second phase after an initial rapid period of adjustment to the diet. During the study a mean of 4.1 +/- 1.4% SD of calculated total body nitrogen was lost. Potassium excretion studies did not reveal significant potassium losses. The amount of nitrogen loss was correlated with the urinary creatinine excretion, suggesting that nitrogen loss during reduced dietary intake of protein is largely dependent on the size of the lean body mass.",eng,0.7073388570391685

The deficiency at the level of manual rapidity is the most important element concerning the motive debility of mentally handicapped children. The tests show that there is no parallelism between the motive retardedness and the level of attainment of the corporal schema. In fact, the motor debility of 8 years old children is emphasized at the age of 10 with reference to normal children. On the other hand, if, at the age of 8, the mentally handicapped children have a lag of the corporal schema acquisition, these children have nearly overcome their retardedness at the age of 10. Therefore one can conclude that the motor retardedness of the slightly mentally handicapped children is not essentially due to a deficiency of the corporal schema integration.",ger,0.554777294878974

Low birthweight (LBW) characterized 6.6% of births in 1971 and 4.6% of births in 1989: this represents a decline of 30% in LBW for the period. The decline was evident for mothers in all age groups, and for all birth parities. However, the prevalence of very low birthweights (less than 1,500 g) remained stable during the period, accounting for 0.8% of births in 1971 and 0.7% in 1989. Preterm births (less than 37 weeks of gestation) increased from 47% of all LBW births in 1971 to 60% in 1989. This shift and the small decline in the prevalence of preterm LBW babies has clinical and preventive implications. These and other findings are based on analysis of 6.6 million single live births between 1971 and 1989.",fre,0.5541059312428263

1981602,M1820871,Fluoride bioavailability from sodium fluoride alone or in association with different calcium salts.,Fluoride pharmacokinetics were studied in twelve healthy subjects after oral administration of one tablet of osteofluor-containing 25 mg of sodium fluoride alone or associated with different calcium salts (500 mg Ca element) given as microcrystalline hydroxyapatite compound or powdered tri-calcium phosphate. Fluoride was measured in plasma and urine with a specific electrode and fluoride bioavailability from the three drugs was compared. Calcium absorption after oral load was assessed by measuring variations from the fasting state of plasma calcium and parathyroid hormone and of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio. The bioavailability of fluoride is significantly decreased by the association to sodium fluoride of hydroxyapatite but not of tri-calcium phosphate. Calcium absorption seems greater after administration of hydroxyapatite compound. The decrease of the fluoride bioavailability is probably dependent on the capacity of calcium absorption from the calcium salts. The association of calcium to fluoride is absolutely required for treatment of osteoporosis. The microcrystalline hydroxyapatite compound seems preferable in view of its greater calcium absorption and of its limited decrease in fluoride bioavailability.,fre,0.5535521933098745

During the reaction of mercaptanes, e.g. cysteine, homocysteine, cysteamine, with dansyl chloride, the corresponding disulfides are formed and dansyl chloride is reduced to 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene 1-sulfinic acid. This reaction is so rapid that the normal dansylation can take place only after complete oxidation of all SH-compounds. Therefore only the dansyl derivatives of the corresponding disulfides are formed during normal dansylation of SH-compounds. If different SH-compounds are present in the reaction mixture mixed disulfides are formed as well. These can be separated by microchromatography on 3 X 3 cm micropolyamide sheets. Dependent on the concentration of dansyl chloride, 6 or even 15 different dansylated disulfides are formed from three different SH-compounds so that interpretation of these chromatograms is difficult.

Ethanol acts via changes in the redox state of co-factors; e.g. ethanol-induced hypoglycemia is due, partly, to the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by ethanol as a consequence of the increased NADH2/NAD ratio in patients whose glycogen stores are already depleted. On the other hand, hyperglycemia has also been described in patients with alcoholism. Although its mechanism is still obscure, abnormal hormonal secretion of insulin, catecholamines and glucocorticoids has been incriminated. Finally, structural changes of the liver and pancreas such as cirrhosis and pancreatitis produced by chronic alcohol consumption should also be considered as pathogenetic factors in a variety of clinical states involving deranged carbohydrate metabolism.",ger,0.5425523573804184

The effect of graded lysine supplemented on the crude nutritional content of the carcas of laying hens.,"In the present work 8 hens taken from each of the 16 experimental groups (90 birds per group) were killed at the end of the trial period (52 weeks). The weight of the organs was determined and bones, the utilizable parts and the residual carcass were analyzed for their crude nutrient content. The experimental birds received rations containing a large proportion of high-protein wheat supplemented with varying levels of lysine. Variations in the lysine supply did not affect the mass of blood, feathers, bones, liver, stomach, heart and ovaries, including ovarian follicles. An analysis of the utilizable parts (flesh, stomach, heart, liver, follicles, fat) for crude nutrients showed that the heavier birds receiving adequate amounts of lysine contained less crude protein and more crude fat than the smaller birds. A positive correlation was found to exist between the crude ash content of these samples (expressed as %) and the levels of lysine supplied during the laying period. All the birds receiving the lysine-deficient ration during the time of rearing or during the laying period contained significantly less crude ash in their bones. Alongside with the crude ash content the phosphorus content of the bones decreased when the birds where fed the diet for laying hens.",ger,0.5423662727898599

The mmHg is an international measurement unit; a new European grading system will make prescribing much more difficult; the degree of arterial insufficiency is calculated by taking systolic pressures by Doppler and is expressed in mmHg; in case of superimposition of elastic stocking, pressure add together but not grades; the unit used for pressure instruments is the mmHg; a clinical situation may require a compression force straddled between two grades; finally, new materials will certainly provide increasingly precise forces.",fre,0.5400909557257242
194423,M10055,Conséquence de l'administration d'adrénolytiques alpha ou beta sur la mobilization des acides gras libres plasmatiques induite par la noradrénaline et l'isoprénaline chez le chien,Noradrénaline or isoprenaline (a beta sympathicomimetic drug) infusion in fasting awake dog provoque a rise of plasmatic FFA. This effect is abolished by administration of propranolol (beta blocking agent) but not by phentolamine (alpha blocking agent). Phentolamine potentiate the rise of FFA in response to noradrenaline but not to isoprenaline. This alpha blocking drug supress the fall of FFA induced by phenylephrine a sympathomimetic drug.,fre,0.5390799830359984
366749,M185717,[Validity of bronchial flow measurement by Wright's air flowmeter. Comparison with maximal expiratory volume in a second].,"The validity of measurement of bronchial air flow, using Wright's air flow meter, was studied comparing the maximum air flow thus obtained with the maximum expiratory volume in one second, used as unit of reference. During a first stage, the reproducibility of the test was determined this was excellent, 3.26% for the maximal flow rate and 2.48% for the maximum volume expired in one second. During a second stage were drawn up correlations between the two tests which were very narrow: O.971 in healthy sbjects, 0.919 in sick patients. The Wright flow meter is a strong, reliable and inexpensive instrument and will thus be very useful in the daily assessment of bronchiolar constriction at the bed side, and in the routine detection of obstructive syndromes.",fre,0.5390393067040457
