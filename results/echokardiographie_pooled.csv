1,1127032,M964829,Echokardiographie,Echocardiography makes possible the analysis of cardiac structures and their dynamics. The presence of valvular disease and its severity can be determined by evaluation of variations in the intensity of reflection and alterations in the motion of valvular structures. The echocardiographic representation of cardiac chambers permits the detection of congenital and acquired structural defects as well as an evaluation of ventricular function. Echocardiography provides a non-invasive means of diagnostic analysis throughout the spectrum of heart diseases and can replace a number of invasive diagnostic procedures.,ger,1.0

11,1080809,M918587,Die Echokardiographie in der Beurteilung der Ventrikelfunktion.,"The ultrasonic beam used for quantitative assessment of left ventricular (LV) function traverses the heart in a projection similar to the familiar angiographic left anterior oblique projection. It crosses the anterior wall of the right ventricle, the right ventricular cavity, the interventricular septum, the LV cavity and the posterior wall of the left ventricle. Whereas the cyclic changes of the right ventricular diameter are rarely clearly determined by echocardiography, the easily assessed cyclic changes of the LV endocardial transverse diameter are useful measure of LV FUNCTION. Of practical importance are the percentage of systolic shortening of the LV diameter (%Sh) and the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF). There are several factors, such as placing of the ultrasonic transducer, the shape and size of the LV cavity and rotational movements of the heart as a whole, that influence echocardiographic determination of the transverse LV diameter. In patients with asynergic contraction, %Sh and VCF cannot be used as measures of overall LV performance, but localized contraction disturbances of the septum and the posterior wall may be detected from the reduced extent of wall motion in a given LV segment during a full sweep from the base to the apex. The most important indications for echocardiographic assessment of LV function are valvar diseases with chronic LV pressure or volume overload, and congestive cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography has proved useful in serial evaluation of LV function in patients undergoing valvar heart surgery. Assessment of LV volume by standard echocardiography using the cubic formula is not satisfactory. More accurate determination of volumes is provided by formulas that include the actual ratio of the LV long axis to the minor axis.",ger,0.896024662724564

The close anatomic vicinity of the transducer to the heart and thoracic aorta allows the use of high frequency devices with better resolution compared to transthoracic echocardiography. Furthermore, the diagnostic gain when evaluating structures that are poorly visualized by the transthoracic approach such as the left atrial appendage, interatrial septum, prosthetic valves and the thoracic aorta is highly improved by TEE. Major indications for TEE include the search for a cardiac source of embolism and cardiac tumors, the work-up prior to balloon mitral valvuloplasty, the evaluation of prosthetic valves and the search for vegetations and aortic dissection.

Normal patients had laminar Doppler auditory signals and time interval histogram flow patterns because right pulmonary artery turbulence was not present during systole or diastole. Patients with pulmonary valvar stenosis had turbulence during systole only. In all nine postoperative patients with surgical shunts, turbulent systolic and diastolic time interval histograms and abnormal auditory signals were present. A typical shunt murmur was not audible to auscultation in six of the postsurgical patients at the time of the study. Suprasternal range-gated pulsed Doppler echocardiography affords an accurate, safe and simple noninvasive bedside means for confirming shunt patency in patients who have undergone surgical systemic artery to pulmonary artery anastomoses.",eng,0.7741722720887597
28,863213,M688146,Detection of pericardial effusion by chest roentgenography and electrocardiography versus echocardiography.,"To determine the sensitivity and specificity of chest roentgenography and electrocardiography in the detection of pericardial effusion, echocardiography was used as the diagnostic standard. Chest roentgenograms and electrocardiograms of 124 patients, 57 of whom had pericardial effusion, were read without knowledge of the echocardiographic interpretation. The sensitivity of roentgenographic diagnosis was low (20%), as was that of diagnosis from decreased voltage on the electrocardiogram (26%). The specificity of the chest roentgenogram was 89% and that of the low-voltage electrocardiogram 97%. The high specificity of the low-voltage electrocardiogram may have been due in part to the exclusion of obese and emphysematous subjects from the study. When cardiomegaly detected roentgenographically or a low-voltage electrocardiogram or both were considered as evidence of pericardial effusion, sensitivity improved to 82% but specificity declined to 29%. It is concluded the chest roentgenography and electrocardiography are unsatisfactory as screening investigations for the detection of pericardial effusion.",eng,0.7740168480547233

In normals aortic blood velocity rose rapidly in early systole to a midsystolic peak then fell to zero velocity. These roughly parabolic patterns had area ratios beneath the first and second halves of the curves measuring 52:48 +/- 3 (SD). With increasingly severe mitral regurgitation the pattern became skewed leftward such that the percent in the first half of systole ranged from 53-79%. From the angiograms of our sixteen patients an estimate of true percent regurgitation was made using the Fick cardiac output and ventricular volume measurements. When compared with the area under the first half of the velocity curve a strong correlation was found (r = 0.84) indicating that this Doppler technique can be used to evaluate mitral insufficiency.",eng,0.7735922738451034

MRA included both 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences. Internal and external carotid artery origins were graded normal, mild, moderate, severe, or critical stenosis, or complete occlusion by each of the three studies.!##!Results!#!Spearman rank correlations of both internal and external carotid artery grades were 0.85 (MRA and XRA), 0.69 (MRA and US), and 0.73 (XRA and US). For internal carotid artery origins only, the correlations were 0.94 (MRA and XRA), 0.85 (MRA and US), and 0.82 (XRA and US). Of discrepancies in internal carotid artery interpretation greater than one grade, seven resulted from US error, three from MRA error, and one from XRA error. A 2-cm partially thrombosed aneurysm detected by US and MRA was missed by XRA. Of 16 possible ulcers on XRA, 11 were noted by MRA, none by US.!##!Conclusions!#!MRA and XRA are similar in assessment of carotid bifurcation stenosis. MRA, like US, permits direct visualization of plaque. This preliminary study suggests that MRA may be used to clarify equivocal findings of US, or replace XRA in presurgical planning.",eng,0.7687466541138169

Cerebral arteriography was performed in 74 patients. Transient ischemic attack was the most common indication for study (30%). The OPG was normal in 95% of cases in which the diameter of the lumen of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was less than 60% reduced; the ocular pulse was delayed in 86% of cases with ICA stenosis of 60% or more. The overall diagnostic accuracy of OPG was 93%; CPA did not enhance the accuracy of OPG alone. Supraorbital Doppler tests detected 88% of cases of ICA stenosis of 60% or more, but there was a 13% false-positive rate with ICA stenosis of less than 60%. Supratrochlear Doppler tests had only a 1% false-positive rate, but detected only 48% of significant ICA stenoses. Doppler studies were most often abnormal in the presence of ICA occlusion. Thus, OPG was as sensitive as supraorbital Doppler and more sensitive than supratrochlear Doppler in detecting hemodynamically significant ICA stenoses, without the unacceptable false-positive rate observed with the supraorbital Doppler test.",eng,0.7639674726773743

Sixteen patients were examined by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and the relation between the variations in transmitral end diastolic pressure gradient and the length of the corresponding cardiac cycles was analysed. Mitral valve surface area (1.65 +/- 0.73 cm2) was determined by the pressure half-time method. The end diastolic transmitral pressure gradient was calculated from the simplified Bernouilli formula applied to end diastolic mitral flow velocity. In each patient, a linear relationship was observed between the end diastolic mitral gradient and the corresponding RR interval. The slope and intercept of the graph correlated significantly to mitral valve surface area (r = 0.72, p < 0.002 and r = 0.93, p < 0.00001, respectively). Using regression equations describing these correlations, it has been possible to construct a nomogramme indicating mitral valve surface area as a function of mitral end diastolic pressure gradient and the duration of the corresponding RR cycle.

It appeared likely that the presence of an ICA stenosis plays a role in the presence of a contralateral bruit where a contralateral stenosis or occlusion are present. 4. An ipsilateral bruit was present in 50/50 ICA occlusions. A contralateral bruit was present in 7 patients the ICA angiogram being normal. A bruit was present on both sides in 4 patients and it may be that some patients are somewhat apt to have bruits. 5.

Now it is equally important in perioperative strategy planning guiding the surgeon's decision throughout the operation as well as in cardiac emergencies. Using intraoperative echocardiography routinely in cardiac surgery establishes a more and more close cooperation between surgeons, cardiologists, and anesthesiologists. In order to evaluate the clinical relevance of echo findings, they have to be repeatedly correlated to surgical realities and to long term results of clinical outcome.",ger,0.8975373562833993
18,599889,M424720,Die Bedeutung der Echokardiographie in der Diagnostik der Herzkrankheiten.,"Single beam echocardiography is now an established diagnostic tool in non-invasive cardiology. The principle indications are valvular diseases, pericardial effusion, aneurysm of the ascending aorta, and congenital heart disease. In the absence of regional contraction disorders, left ventricular function can be assessed by the extent of systolic shortening of the left ventricular diameter. More recently, two-dimensional echocardiography has made a very significant contribution to anatomical and functional evaluation of the heart and the great vessels, since the cardiac structures can be visualized in various cross-sections. This technique is especially helpful for the assessment of left ventricular regional contraction disturbances, the diagnosis of dysfunction of artificial valves and bioprotheses, the detection of dissecting aneurysm, and the estimation of mitral valve area in mitral stenosis. Since various left ventricular axes can be determined, the quantitation of left heart volumes appears to be within the capability of the two-dimensional technique.",ger,0.8956800228223937
32,805566,M630487,Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201: correlation with coronary arteriography and electrocardiography.,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 and electrocardiography with the subject at rest and undergoing submaximal treadmill exercise were performed in 19 men and 3 women. Selective coronary arteriography and left ventriculography showed that 7 had normal coronary arteries and 15 had coronary artery disease.The 11 persons with electrocardiographic evidence of an old myocardial infarct (q waves) had a perfusion defect at rest in the area of the infarct and a segmental abnormality of wall motion apparent on the left ventriculogram corresponding to the perfusion defect.MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY WERE EQUALLY SENSITIVE IN DETECTING CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN EXERCISING INDIVIDUALS: perfusion defects were noted in 7 of the 15 persons with coronary artery disease, and diagnostic ST-segment depression was present in 8 of the 15. Combination of the results of the two tests with exercise permitted the identification of 11 of the 15 persons and improved the sensitivity. Combination of the results of rest and exercise imaging and electrocardiography permitted the identification of 94% of the patients with coronary artery disease.Myocardial perfusion imaging with (201)TI in the subject at rest is a sensitive indicator of previous myocardial infarction. Imaging after the subject has exercised is a useful adjunct to conventional exercise electrocardiography, especially in those whose exercise electrocardiogram is non-interpretable.",eng,0.7706626805944916
33,1597490,M1436411,Hemodynamic effects of preoperative embolization in cerebral arteriovenous malformations: evaluation with transcranial Doppler sonography.,"A series of 83 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations is presented. All patients were evaluated with transcranial Doppler sonography. Thirty-two patients were treated with staged embolization and surgery: 19 of these patients were operated on within 4 weeks of the last embolization, and the remaining 13 patients underwent surgery 6 months or more from embolization. Transcranial Doppler sonography performed 1 day after embolization showed a significant (> 60%) reduction of main feeder flow velocity in 72% of patients after the first embolization and in 45% of patients after the second embolization. In no case did such a significant reduction occur after the third embolization. A flow redistribution in the basal vessels (defined as an increase in flow velocity of at least 30% of the initial value) occurred only in patients after the first embolization (64%). On delayed post-embolization studies, complete recovery of flow velocity in the embolized vessel occurred in 46% of patients, and sonographic recruitment of new feeders occurred in the remaining 54%. When main feeder flow velocity (mean) was higher than 120 cm/s after embolization and before surgery, the incidence of postoperative hyperemic complications (cerebral edema and/or intracerebral hematoma) was significantly higher than in patients with a mean flow velocity under 120 cm/s. It is concluded that transcranial Doppler sonography is a valuable method for a noninvasive hemodynamic assessment of shunt flow in arteriovenous malformations, and it permits a physiological monitoring of hemodynamic changes after embolization and allows more precise indications regarding further stages of embolization and timing of surgery after embolization.",eng,0.7704357303185865

38,94332,M27062685,Image-guided transcranial Doppler sonography for monitoring of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Objectives!#!Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a standard method for bedside vasospasm monitoring after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Image guidance has previously been shown to reduce intra- and interobserver variability of this method. The aim of the present study was to compare image-guided and conventional TCD in vasospasm monitoring after SAH.!##!Patients and methods!#!418 TCD exams of 24 consecutive SAH patients registered in a database were evaluated. Of these, 130 image-guided exams were identified which had been performed on the same day as conventional Doppler exams. These matched pairs were taken for statistical analysis. Data were tested statistically using the sign test applied at patient level to aggregated data.!##!Results!#!The rate of complete exams (both M1, A1, P1 segments) was significantly higher in image-guided exams (92% vs. 74%, p<0.001), and the superiority of image-guided exams was significantly related to smaller sizes of the temporal bone window. There were more exams with Doppler sonographic vasospasm (mean flow velocity>120cm/s) in image-guided exams (38% vs. 33%) which, however, did not reach statistical significance.!##!Conclusion!#!Image-guidance leads to a standardization of serial TCD exams, which resulted in significantly more complete exams, most prominent in patients with poor temporal bone windows, and a higher detection rate of Doppler sonographic vasospasms. Image-guided TCD therefore has the capability to improve bedside vasospasm monitoring after SAH.",eng,0.7680862362382033

The biopsy effectuated in stereotaxic conditions permits to solve the problem in uncertain cases. The interest of computorized tomography is emphasized (discovery or confirmation of a suspected tumor, definition of its extension in depth), but this recent technic is incapable of constant confirmation of the histological diagnosis; it cannot replace other confirmed methods of diagnosis. The angiography remains necessary to guide the surgical gesture.",fre,0.7123297535771904
