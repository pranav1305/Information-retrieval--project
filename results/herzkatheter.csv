1159864,M997705,Ein Prozessrechnersystem für Herzkatheterlabor und Hämodynamikmessplätze,"In cooperation with the Department of Electronic Data Processing Systems we have developed a data processing unit for the analysis of hemodynamic data at the Department of Internal Medicine I. The aim was to design a computer-system for the daily routine in heart-catheterizations as well as for the solution of scientific problems during hemodynamic studies. In the on-line-mode besides the ECG up to four pressures can be analysed simultaneously. Analog and digital tapes can also be processed off-line on demand. The concept of the whole system and the individual steps of computer-handling are adjusted to the problems of data-analysis in praxis from the viewpoint of the examining cardiologist. Since the system is interactive after each measurement and each given command the computer-results are displayed on the video-scope. Because of the modular structure of the program new medical criteria can easily be implemented at any time. Since the computer-system is not effectively used with only one cath-lab other units possibly of different hard-ware configuration can be connected simultaneously to the computer. Each cath-lab shares 16 K out of the total 32 K core-memory. The results are displayed graphically and alpha-numerically on video-scope, x-y-plotter and line printer. The sampling-rate for fluid-filled catheters is 200 Hz and for catheter-tip-manometers 400 Hz. Smothing and differentiation-procedures are adapted to the respective catheter-material. The computer-program calibrates the different pressure amplifiers automatically. After defining the catheter-position the pressure-signals are sampled for 10 s and immediately afterwards analyzed by the computer. The ECG and the corresponding pressure-curves are displayed on the video-scope. The automatically selected representative beat as well as each of the identified and numerated other beats of the sampling-phase can be displayed selectively together with its numerical results. The computer marks the positions within the pressure-curves, where the individual measurements were taken. Besides the systolic and diastolic pressures in valvular stenosis the maximal and mean systolic or diastolic gradients, ejection- or filling-period, valve-flow and valve-area are calculated autonomously. The calculation of cardiac-output, different volume-indices and stroke-work-index are based on Fick-method, thermo- or indicator-dilution technique. The contractility-parameters max dp/dt, t-max dp/dt, max dp/dt/DP, max dp/dt/P, VPM, V40, min dp/dt and the stiffness are computed for the left and on demand also for the right ventricle. Data of the patient and the operating-team, catheter-technique, complications and free comments are transmitted to the computer via terminal together with the actual time. The computer-system was drafted for permanent use. Therefore possible technical defects have been anticipated in the design of hard- and soft-ware. In cases of failure suitable steps allow the immediate restart of the system without loosing information...",ger,0.9120077177067006

Ein Erfahrungsbericht über 497 Katheter in 5 Jahren.,"Background and methods!#!Central catheters are an important prerequisite for adequate parenteral nutrition in preterm infants. However, a variety of complications have been shown to be associated with central lines: septicemica, thrombotic complications, mechanical complications. In this retrospective analysis we summarize our recent experience with central silastic catheters.!##!Results!#!Within a five-year-period (1986-1990). 497 silastic-catheters were inserted in 366 high risk neonates (mean birthweight 1360 g; 1060-1740 g, 25.-75. percentile) treated at the NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University of Göttingen. 451 catheters which were placed in a central position, were removed after an average duration of 11 days (mean; 8-18 days, 25.-75. percentile). During the observation period, 62.8 percent of the catheters were purposely removed. Making use of the Kaplan-Meier-curve, we calculated how long the catheter could stay without complications; 50% of all catheters could be expected to be in place for 25 days. The incidence of septicemia was 1.9%, bacterial contamination of the catheters was evident in 22% of all central lines. The most predominant microorganisms responsible for catheter-contamination were coagulase-negative staphylococci. In addition, catheters were removed because of signs of phlebitis or suspected thrombotic complications (11.1%), and mechanical complications (dislocation, occlusion; 11.7%). Due to malposition of the central catheter two preterm infants developed pericardial effusions. There was no correlation between the site where the catheter was inserted and these complications.!##!Conclusion!#!Central silastic catheters wherever clinically indicated are a valuable adjunct in the parenteral nutrition on high risk neonates.",ger,0.815073919086166

Local bleeding ceased after compression of 4 min in 48 of the 50 patients. A pressure bandage was needed additionally in the other two. Bed-rest lasted for 1-24 (median 19) hours. A haematoma of more than 6 cm diameter developed in five patients, but required neither transfusion nor surgical intervention. 39 of the 50 patients were re-examined after a median of 39 days: all of them had had a small pain-free swelling for 2-6 weeks over the puncture site. One patient developed a deep-vein thrombosis one week after the procedure, in another fever occurred after the same period, lasting for two days. These early findings are encouraging.

This study reports on the experience with a group of 89 patients with 100 heart valve prostheses who were examined by spin-echo MR and gradient-echo MR. MR examination was performed in all patients without complications. The spin-echo sequence showed advantages in the depiction of anatomical structures like paravalvular abscesses. Anatomical structures adjacent to the artificial valve were clearly visible and the metal components of the valves showed no or only small artifacts. Artifacts were accentuated when using gradient-echo sequences. Gradient-echo sequences provided valuable information regarding the presence of valvular insufficiency. Physiological valvular regurgitation was easy to differentiate from pathological paravalvular or transvalvular regurgitation. These results demonstrate that patients with artificial valve prostheses can be imaged by MR without risk and that prosthesis-induced artifacts do no interfere with image interpretation.",ger,0.8065700044345254

1926275,M1765344,Kardiologische Diagnostik bei arteriellen Embolien.,"Potential cardiac sources of arterial embolism are in particular thrombi within the left atrium or ventricle, or attached to a prosthetic valve, intracardiac tumors, and vegetations due to endocarditis. Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect may lead to paradoxical embolism, and spontaneous echo contrast within the heart has to be considered as a parameter of increased thromboembolic risk. In rare cases, atrial septal aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse or annulus calcification and calcified aortic stenosis has to be taken into consideration. Current method of choice for diagnosis of these abnormalities is echocardiography. When the transthoracic approach fails, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) leads to a definite diagnosis in most cases. Precordial echocardiography allows the detection of left ventricular thrombi with a sensitivity ranging between 72 and 95%, and monoplane TEE does usually not increase these numbers. In contrast, thrombi within the left atrium and particularly in the left atrial appendage can be detected with a significantly higher detection rate when TEE is used. The same is true for spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium, a phenomenon which is almost exclusively diagnosed by TEE, as well as for endocarditis associated vegetations that can be identified by TEE with a sensitivity higher than 90%. Patient foramen ovale is usually diagnosed by precordial contrast echocardiography combined with a Valsalva maneuver; color Doppler or contrast TEE allows to increase the detection rate. In the diagnosis of prosthetic valve attached thrombi and vegetations, TEE is clearly superior compared to the precordial examination, at least concerning prosthetic devices in mitral position. If echocardiography fails to identify a potential cardiac source of embolism, other techniques don't add significant information in most cases. Detection of a potential source of embolism, however, does not necessarily prove that the particular finding represents the true etiology of an embolic event; results of all clinical and technical examinations have to be evaluated in a critical synopsis. In addition, proper therapeutic consequences in quite a number of abnormalities considered as potential cardiac sources of embolism are not yet defined.",ger,0.7978599110967267

From January 1983 to December 1990, 24 PTA procedures were performed for TRAS in 18 patients. The stenoses were anastomotic in two cases, in the main renal artery in 14, and segmental in eight. After PTA, the residual stenosis was less than 20% in 14 (58%), 20%-50% in four (17%), and greater than 50% in six (25%). The mean diastolic blood pressure decreased from 106 mm Hg 1 day prior to PTA to 82 mm Hg 1 day after PTA. Long-term follow-up mean diastolic blood pressure (at 2-32 months) was 93 mm Hg (P less than .01). Eleven of the 18 patients (63%) had a 10% or greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure on long-term follow-up. Major complications occurred in two patients; one groin hematoma required surgical evacuation, and one polar infarct led to hypertension that was difficult to control. No surgical revisions of the transplant renal artery were necessary. The authors' data indicate that PTA should remain the treatment of choice for nonanastomotic TRAS.",eng,0.7502563754515396

1702484,M1541446,Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.,"Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is now practised worldwide and offered to patients as a viable alternative to coronary artery bypass graft surgery or pharmacological therapy. However, despite its undoubted popularity, there is still a substantial amount of mystery surrounding this treatment modality. Firstly, we really don't know how it ""works"" or, why it ""works"" in some patients and not in others; secondly, we're not quite certain how to describe the impact of treatment with PTCA on the beneficiary insert; by the effect on the lesion itself as measured by coronary angiography, or by the effect on coronary blood flow, which is also measurable by various techniques, or by the effect on myocardial perfusion which can also be ""objectively assessed"", or indeed, by its impact on the well-being of the patient, which cannot actually be measured, but is the primary aim of the treatment as offered to the patient - since there is no evidence supporting a beneficial effect for PTCA on longevity (unlike CABG in certain patient subgroups). Thirdly, similar difficulties exist regarding the assessment of the long-term benefit of PTCA, which are further compounded by the variable response, over time, of the vessel wall to balloon dilatation, a process known as ""restenosis"", or the ""Achilles heel"". The main difficulties in this area are that: a) the pathology of the process is poorly understood, and much mystery and doubt still lingers, b) there is no universal agreement on how to define ""restenosis"", c) although angiography appears to be the best widely available descriptive technique, many investigators continue to use antiquated analysis methodology, the inaccuracy of which has been frequently and conclusively demonstrated. Fourthly, the introduction of new devices, instead of bringing answers or solutions, has further compounded the problem, by thus far failing to reduce restenosis, while increasing the armimentarium, and therefore, ""the doctor's dilemma"". In this treatise we present the pathological theory of restenosis and its clinical correlations, we identify the difficulties in its assessment, and propose our solution to this significant aspect of the problem. We provide an extensive summary of pharmacological attempts to prevent restenosis, a description of the new devices and their potential role, as well as a though for the future.",eng,0.7501098758712632

Using this system, 110 patients have been treated with active hemoperfusion during routine PTCA. In eight cases, no preperfusion tolerated inflation time was obtained. In 96 of 102 cases, the tolerated inflation time was increased by at least 50%, for a success rate of 94%.

Decreased isotope uptake after captopril by the right kidney assisted in the selection of the right renal artery for angioplasty. Post-angioplasty improvement in both blood pressure control and renal function was accompanied by an absence of effect of captopril on the isotope uptake by the right kidney.

Indication for PTCA was stenosis of > or = 70%, anginal symptoms, and objective signs of myocardial ischemia. The immediate success rate was 81.2%, and severe complications occurred in 7.1%, which included two fatal complications (0.3%). Repeat angiograms were performed in 582 of 648 patients who underwent successful dilatation and showed restenosis in 143 cases (24.6%). Within 1 year after the first dilatation, 586 patients had been successfully revascularized by PTCA (i.e., there was no evidence of restenosis or redilatation was successful), and 113 patients had undergone bypass surgery. The remaining 99 patients were treated medically if PTCA was unsuccessful or if restenosis (> or = 70%) that was not amenable to redilatation was present. The 8-year overall survival probability was 91.7%, and cardiac survival was 95.5%. The 8-year event-free survival probability was 52.7% for all patients: 62.5% in patients who had successful PTCA and 14.5% in patients who had unsuccessful PTCA (p = 0.0000). The cardiac survival probabilities of patients with lasting PTCA success at 1 year and of surgically treated patients were significantly better than those of patients who did not have successful revascularization (at 8 years 97.2% and 98.1% vs 88.9%; p < 0.04). Late events (> or = 1 year) occurred more often in patients who did not have successful revascularization compared with patients who had successful PTCA (at 8 years 57.9% were event-free vs 74.4%; p < 0.0001); even fewer late events were observed in surgically treated patients (at 8 years 88.2% were event-free; p < 0.004). Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis revealed left ventricular ejection fraction and revascularization status at 1 year as determinants of overall, cardiac, infarct-free, and event-free survival probabilities. At the time of reevaluation significantly more patients in the successful PTCA subgroup were still free of symptoms or had experienced improvement than patients in the bypass or medical subgroups (86.8% vs 68.9% and 59.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001), and more patients in the successful PTCA subgroup were still working (75.4% vs 53.3% and 56.9%, respectively; p < 0.001).

Twenty-nine patients showed improvement in cardiac function during follow-up examination. Because of acute deterioration in clinical status, emergency bypass was later necessary in five patients; three showed electrocardiographic evidence of infarcts. Patients with single-vessel disease appear to be most suitable for the procedure, and a short history of pain indicates the presence of a soft (distensible) atheroma likely to respond to dilatation. We estimate that only about 10 to 15 per cent of candidates for bypass surgery have lesions suitable for this procedure.

On the basis of a series of 25 cases, we propose in these serious forms the following therapeutic escalation: very high dose corticotherapy, with betamethasone at 0.12 to 0.48 mg/kg/day for 15 days, followed by a degressive treatment over 6 weeks to 3 months; intubation to overcome a difficult stage in the event of aggravation of the angioma with a rhinopharyngitis. Embolization and the use of the laser proved unsatisfactory in the extensive forms of angiomas. In the event of failure of the preceding treatment, we perform a tracheotomy, the duration of which can be reduced by the surgical exeresis of the angioma with a widening of the larynx.",fre,0.6912739957157844
