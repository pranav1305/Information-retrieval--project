1745976,M1584957,Multiinfarkt- und Alzheimersche Demenz--differentialdiagnostische Probleme.,"The differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's and so-called multi-infarct dementia is still a major problem in clinical dementia research. It was Binswanger who in 1894 pointed out that a subtype of vascular dementia exists which is characterized by subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. It is this type that can most easily be mistaken for Alzheimer's dementia, presented for the first time in 1906, which may be associated with congophilic angiopathy leading to brain infarction. Beyond clinical criteria, which in part are summarized in Hachinski's ischemic score, further advancement of brain imaging techniques, especially those yielding perfusion or metabolic data, has facilitated and substantiated clinical in vivo distinction.",ger,0.8513393533204965

After a single oral dose of 10 mg sabeluzole, the peak plasma concentration was attained at 1 to 4 h; it averaged 42 ng.ml-1. On repeated dosing (10 mg b.d.), steady-state was virtually attained after 3 days of treatment. Steady-state mean trough and peak plasma concentrations fluctuated between 53 and 94 ng.ml-1. The mean terminal half-life after a single dose and at steady-state was of the order of 33 h.

1963715,M1802962,"Quantitative neuropathological study of Alzheimer-type pathology in the hippocampus: comparison of senile dementia of Alzheimer type, senile dementia of Lewy body type, Parkinson's disease and non-demented elderly control patients.","A Lewy body dementing syndrome in the elderly has been recently described and designated senile dementia of Lewy body type (SDLT) on the basis of a distinct clinicopathological profile. The pathological changes seen in SDLT include the presence of cortical Lewy bodies (LB) frequently, but not invariably, associated with senile plaque (SP) formation. Whilst neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are sparse or absent, a proportion of these cases show involvement of the temporal archicortex by lesions comprising Alzheimer-type pathology (ATP, i.e. NFT, SP and granulovacuolar degeneration [GVD]). Thus the relationship between SDLT and senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) is complex and controversial. In this study quantitative neuropathology was used to compare the intensity and distribution of ATP in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of 53 patients from 3 disease groups (SDLT, SDAT, Parkinson's disease (PD)) and a group of neurologically and mentally normal elderly control patients. For most brain areas examined the extent of ATP between the patient groups followed the trend SDAT greater than SDLT greater than PD greater than control. Statistical comparison of these groups revealed significant differences between the mean densities of NFT, SP and GVD although individual cases showed considerable variability. These results confirm additional pathological differences between SDAT and SDLT regarding the intensity of involvement of the temporal archicortex by ATP. Many patients with Lewy body disorders (LBdis) show a predisposition to develop ATP albeit in a more restricted distribution (e.g. low or absent neocortical NFT) and at lower densities than is found in SDAT. Some cases of SDLT show minimal SP and NFT formation in both neocortex and archicortex supporting previously published data distinguishing this group from Alzheimer's disease.",eng,0.7898565324673146

We evaluated the cerebrovascular responsiveness to hypercapnia to clarify the differences in the cerebral hemodynamics between two groups of patients. The subjects were eight younger control subjects, five age-matched control subjects, five Alzheimer's patients, and five patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type.!##!Summary of report!#!In the resting state, the regional cerebral blood flow was low in both Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. The responsiveness to hypercapnia was preserved in Alzheimer's dementia, whereas it was impaired in vascular dementia of the Binswanger type in the cerebral cortices and in the deep white matter.!##!Conclusions!#!These results suggest that small vascular lesions exist in vascular dementia of the Binswanger type but not in Alzheimer's dementia, even though regional cerebral blood flow was thought to decrease by hypometabolism in both types of dementia.",eng,0.7892210551887732

In AD/SDAT, there was a significant decrease in the DA concentration and a significant increase in the MHPG concentration. The average NE concentration was not altered, but significantly increased with the progression of intellectual disability. There were no significant changes in HVA and 5-HIAA concentrations. Patients with VDBT showed a significant increase in the DA concentration and a significant decrease in HVA and 5-HIAA concentrations. The DA concentrations increased significantly with the progression of dementia and ventricular enlargement.

Despite the varied etiology the clinical consequences are relatively stereotyped which suggests that the diverse insults that cause delirium may act by common metabolic and cellular ""final pathways."" Related molecular and cellular mechanisms may be involved in aging and Alzheimer's disease, conditions that predispose to the development of delirium. Animal models of delirium better reflect age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease than those that impair a single neurotransmitter system such as the cholinergic system; the metabolic encephalopathies produce global cognitive disturbance, which is more typical of these disorders.

One investigation included 98 patients in whom Alzheimer type dementia (AD/SDAT) and vascular dementia (VD) had been diagnosed, many of whom also had emotional disturbances. After four weeks treatment with Citalopram (10-30 mg/daily) there was significant improvement in confusion, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood and restlessness. No effect was seen on the intellectual capacity or motor performance measured. In the other study, which was a six weeks trial comparing Citalopram and placebo, elderly patients with a treatment-requiring depression were treated. Demented as well as non-demented patients were included. The Hamilton Depression Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and The Clinical Global Impressions all recorded an effect of Citalopram superior to that of placebo. In both studies depressive symptoms as well as symptoms of agitation, anxiety, restlessness and irritability improved. Citalopram is therefore considered not only an antidepressive drug but also an emotional stabilizer. The drug was well tolerated by elderly often somatically ill patients.
