Between primiparae, secundiparae, and multiparae, working and housewife mothers, workers, farmerettes, women doing other jobs, and academically trained women, eutrophic mature and hypertrophic mature neonates, and newly born male and female babies there was observed a roughly similar frequency of the generally accepted ""normal weight of placenta"" of 400 g to 600 g and no significance of minor differences in frequency, respectively. 2. The high incidence of mothers aged 20 and less in the ""normal placental weight group"" of 400 g to 600 g compared to 21- to 30-year-old and 31- to 35-year-old mothers was not found to be significant. 3. The high incidence of unmarried mothers in the ""normal placental weight group"" of 400 g to 600 g compared to married mothers is not significant, the higher incidence of premature labor in unmarried women being due possibly, not to the weight of placenta, but rather primiparity, age under 20, and social class. 4. The higher frequency in the placental weight group up to and including 400 g of married compared to unmarried mothers, primiparae compared to secundiparae, primiparae and secundiparae compared to multiparae, working mothers compared to housewife mothers, and workers and farmerettes compared to both women doing other types of jobs and academically trained women was not found to be significant.",ger,0.8245779918481124
1169626,M1007504,Biographical situation of scoliotic children and their relationship to the social environment(author's transl).,"Studies were conducted to determine whenther or not scoliosis in childhood affects the behavior and experience of the affected children. Two groups of scoliotic and nonscoliotic children were examined with selected psychological tests. No differences could be found in regard to neuroticism, extraversion, manifest fear or the children's self-image. Differences were found in regard to the social environment which scoliotic children experienced as more demanding and supportive. As a result they were more concerned with achievement in a performance situation and more confident of success. The type and extent of the psychological effects of scoliosis is determined by the position accorded to the children by the social environment. Negative consequences can best be dealt with by educating the parents.",ger,0.8217978749583038

198877,M14648,An experimental and clinical pharmacological study of the influence of triamterene on the diuretic and saluretic properties of furosemide xantinol.,"The diuretic and saluretic effect of furosemide xantinol administered alone and mixed with different amounts of 2,4,7-triamino-6-phenylpteridine (triamterene) have been investigated in rat and man. The presence of triamterene resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of furosemide xantinol induced diuresis in both species. It was necessary to reduce the amount of triamterene present in the mixture to approximately half that of the one theoretically required according to considerations of the recommended therapeutic doses of the two diuretics before significant inhibition was avoided. Nevertheless, this reduced amount of triamterene proved sufficient to inhibit the distal tubular exchange of Na+ for K+ and H+ and a mixture formulated to give the ratio of 40 mg furosemide xantinol (as base) plus 25 mg triamterene (Salidur) was shown to produce a smooth but efficient loss of water and Na+ in the absence of detectable kaliuresis or reduction in urinary pH, thereby reducing the usual risk of inducing hypokalaemic alkalosis.",ger,0.81617903218007

Patients of the age group of 20-24 years were overrepresented (p less than 0,05) as well as patients of the lower socio-economic classes and patients whose parents were less than 20 years old at the time of the patients' birth. The structure of the family in childhood showed significant differences concerning patients with different social contacts and different diagnoses. Patients who grew up in big families have themselves a relatively large number of children and vice versa (p less than 0,01). A significant correlation (p less than 0,01) consists also between the number of siblings of the patients and the socio-economic class they belong to: Patients from the underprivileged socio-economic classes mostly grew up in big families.",ger,0.8069914460654085

We investigated how mixed and redundant information carried by neuroreceptors could be efficiently coded by output neurons in the second neuronal layer in the brain. We showed that a good discrimination is yielded if neuroreceptors that terminate on the same output neuron belong to several types, if these types are in different proportions for each output neuron, and if each output neuron exerts an action on all others so that their independence is maximized, according to the Jutten and Hérault algorithm for separating linear mixtures of independent sources. The proposed model details the computations made by neurons and leads to a better understanding of several observed properties of the olfactory system, among which the inhibitory actions of local neurons of the second layer and the identifiability of insect glomeruli.",fre,0.7881414352933643

Children in Canada experienced a greater decrease in mortality during this period than did all children in the United States. In particular, while mortality rates for both boys and girls in Canada were higher than those for White children in the United States in 1971, in 1989 the rates for Canadian children were lower. Seniors in Canada experienced a similar or lesser reduction in age-specific mortality than did seniors in the United States. Even though senior women in the United States experienced a reduction in mortality comparable to that of senior women in Canada, Canadian senior women in general had lower level of mortality than their counterparts in the United States. Senior men in the United States experienced a relatively greater reduction than did their counterparts in Canada. The greater decline in mortality for senior men in the United States enabled them to catch up with the lower level of mortality for their Canadian counterparts in 1989. These general conclusions apply whether we compare the Canadian experience to that of the entire population or the White population in the United States. These trends in mortality reductions may reflect the fact that free universal Medicare is available for all ages in Canada, while most publicly-funded Medicare entitlements begin at age 65 in the United States.",fre,0.7754534612752247

These years have witnessed what has been described as a conquest of tuberculosis in Canada. To quote George Jasper Wherrett in the Miracle of the Empty Beds: One hundred years ago the word consumption (as tuberculosis was then called) struck horror in human hearts. Today, in the western world, it barely evokes any emotion save a too easy surprise that it still exists. This statistical chronicle of tuberculosis in Canada is divided into two parts. Part I: From the Era of Sanatorium Treatment to the Present pulls together data from yellowed-with-age reports on tuberculosis and vital statistics, historical accounts, and modern computer files, to document the changes in tuberculosis incidence and mortality over past decades to the present. Part II: Risk Today and Control takes a closer look at those most vulnerable to contracting tuberculosis. It also looks at the future, the need for maintaining and, indeed, strengthening vigilance, and the work yet to be done to eradicate tuberculosis in Canada.

The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review was the privately owned older journal, and the American Journal of Nursing was the voice of the professional organization. Each journal was edited by a strong nursing leader, Janet Geister and Mary Roberts, respectively. Each editor had many years of service to the nursing profession in varied capacities. Naturally, each had distinctly different interests, visions, and styles of communication. These editors witnessed and commented on the change in the sphere of nursing practice from a private duty and public health orientation to one that eventually became dominated by the hospital. Although their approaches differed, both recognized the need for organization, versatility, and creative problem solving. However, the legacy of these leaders must be considered in view of the gap that continues to exist between practicing nurses and the American Nurses' Association leadership.",eng,0.7270658149129208

In the field of psychiatry the experience in a local sub-regional training scheme suggests that graduates of a high calibre can be attracted back to this speciality on a part-time basis for training; the training has been acceptable for full qualification and the examination success rate is high; part-time appointments, including senior registrar and consultant posts, can be obtained; it would not appear that training need, in the first instance, be confined to those people working in a main teaching centre; the satisfactory resolution of any conflict between trainees' domestic and professional commitments is important, as is a flexible approach to the individual professional needs of the trainees.
