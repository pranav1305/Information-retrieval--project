1457456,M1296312,Epidémiologie de l'asthme.,"Asthma epidemiology aims to provide answers to the following questions: what is the prevalence? what are the consequences? what are the risk factors of asthma? Questionnaires indicate that asthma prevalence averages 6 to 8% whereas assessment of bronchial reactivity reveals that approximately 15% of the population exhibit bronchial hyperesponsiveness; these figures have been increasing in many western countries. Asthma is an important cause of impairment in children physical development, school-related problems along with increased number and duration of hospitalizations. Asthma mortality averages 3/100,000 in France and is mainly focused on people more than 50 years old; its increase is very likely in some countries, but is still controversial in France. Environmental and socio-economic factors play a major role in the development of asthma and genetic factors are now under investigation. Although both understanding and drug treatment of asthma have dramatically improved in the recent past, no positive change has been observed so far in terms of morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, knowledge of factors specific to France requires further investigations.",fre,0.9591228547974916
1373805,M1212525,Epidémiologie du cancer colo-rectal,Some of the more recent contributions of epidemiology to knowledge of the causation of colo-rectal are reviewed. Geographical differences and changes in migrants suggest the importance of enviornmental (especially dietary) factors. High dietary fat is believed to stimulate increased bile secretion and thus provide a substrate for bacterial conversion to carcinogens or co-carcinogens. The association of beef consumption to colorectal cancer may relate to the fat content of beef. There is so far little direct evidence to support the alternative dietary fibre deficiency hypothesis.,fre,0.9009753989158495

1605247,M1444188,Epidémiologie et prévention du cancer colo-rectal.,"Colorectal carcinoma is very common in western countries. It is in the front line of malignant pathology in France. The estimated number of new cases is almost 26,000 per year. The role played by diet in the onset of colorectal carcinomas is well established. The majority of studies indicate the protective role played by green vegetables. The role of other factors remains controversial: protective role of fibres, calcium and vitamins and favorizing role of fats, proteins, red meat, alcohol and calorie intake. The role of bile salts in increasing the size of adenomas and their malignant change is accepted. A number of therapeutic trials have involved modifications in bile salt concentrations. These should enable the proposal of a primary prevention strategy. The early detection of carcinomas and the secondary prevention of colorectal carcinoma (by detection of the adenomas which precede a high proportion of carcinomas) are areas of great interest. Detection of occult blood in stools as a mass screening test is currently being evaluated. Methods used to obtain a high participation rate among the population vary from one country to another, but are now well-defined. It will be necessary to wait for 2 years before being able to determine the effect on mortality and an even longer period to evaluate the effect on the incidence of colorectal carcinoma.",fre,0.8754873288805871

However the essential traits and above all their place amongst other risk factors remain controversial. The authors undertook a prospective study involving three male populations grouping 2147 adult subjects. Amongst the questions considered, there was the choice of a simple a quick psychological approach applicable to a population ranging over all cultural levels. The study shows that the Bortner auto-transference scale fulfils all these requirements. Thus a given type of behaviour may be analysed as a risk factor, in the same way as various examinations such a blood pressure or cholesterol level.",fre,0.8570051957225858

Pockets of high prevalence up to 15% and even 35% can be observed. The transmission of HTLV-I includes: maternal to offspring through breast feeding, sexual mainly from men to women and through blood exchange (blood transfusion, intravenous drug abusers, etc.) The diseases being proven to be caused by HTLV-I, include acute adult T cell leukemias as described in Japan, in 1977, in which the HTLV-I provirus is clonally integrated in leukemic cells, and a progressive spastic encephalomyelopathy named TSP/HAM, frequent in HTLV-I endemic areas, and in which an active viral replication takes place.

The morbidity rate of taeniosis was calculated at first by the number of notified cases and also by the quantity of anthelmintics in the treatment of T. saginata infections in humans. The morbidity based on notifications did not show any relations to the frequency of metacestodes of T. saginata in cattle. This morbidity rate gave an exact relation to the number of notified cases but not to the number of real cases of cestodes in humans. On the contrary, the theoretical morbidity based on used anthelmintics developed parallel to the degree of infestation in cattle. Therefore this theoretical morbidity is very suitable for epidemiological studies of taeniosis.",ger,0.7486207277607257

In addition, relevant articles, books, and monographs identified from the reference list of retrieved articles were reviewed.!##!Study selection!#!Case-control studies, descriptive epidemiologic surveys, and case series were chosen for review.!##!Data extraction!#!Because of the limited scope of the pertinent research literature, all data relevant to the incidence, demographics, circumstances, and precipitants of murder-suicide were summarized by the authors.!##!Data synthesis!#!Murder-suicide occurs with an annual incidence of 0.2 to 0.3 per 100,000 person-years and accounts for approximately 1000 to 1500 deaths yearly in the United States. The annual incidence of these events is relatively constant across industrialized nations and has not significantly changed over several decades. The principal perpetrators are young males with intense sexual jealousy, depressed mothers, or despairing elderly men with ailing spouses. The principal victims are female sexual partners or consanguineous relatives, usually young children. Clinical depression, specific motivations such as male sexual proprietariness or maternal salvation fantasies, and a history of previous suicide attempts are important in explaining underlying psychopathological mechanisms.!##!Conclusions!#!Murder-suicide occupies a distinct epidemiological domain that overlaps with suicide, domestic homicide, and mass murder. These events may be categorized into one of only several phenomenologic typologies that share similar demographics, motivations, and circumstances. Despite the disruption of families and communities caused by murder-suicide, there are no standardized operational definitions, validated taxonomic systems, or national surveillance networks for these events, all of which are needed to develop prevention strategies.",eng,0.744226882932195

1423289,M1262118,Against Popperized epidemiology.,The recommendation of Popper's philosophy of science should be adopted by epidemiologists is disputed. Reference is made to other authors who have shown that the most constructive elements in Popper's ideas have been advocated by earlier philosophers and have been used in epidemiology without abandoning inductive reasoning. It is argued that Popper's denigration of inductive methods is particularly harmful to epidemiology. Inductive reasoning and statistical inference play a key role in the science; it is suggested that unfamiliarity with these ideas contributes to widespread misunderstanding of the function of epidemiology. Attention is drawn to a common fallacy involving correlations between three random variables. The prevalence of the fallacy may be related to confusion between deductive and inductive logic.,eng,0.744226882932195

31794,M28166102,Outcome-wide Epidemiology.,"The author proposes that epidemiologic studies should more often assess the associations of a single exposure with multiple outcomes simultaneously. Such ""outcome-wide epidemiology"" will be especially important for exposures that may be beneficial for some outcomes but harmful for others. Outcome-wide epidemiology may also be helpful in prioritizing public health recommendations. Methodologically, the conduct of outcome-wide epidemiology will generally be more straightforward than recent proposals for exposure-wide epidemiologic studies, in which the associations between a single outcome and many exposures are assessed simultaneously. Such exposure-wide studies are likely to be subject to numerous biases because of the inability to make simultaneous confounding control and because exposures are likely to affect, and mediate the effects of, other exposures. These problems simplify considerably in an outcome-wide approach when a single exposure is being considered. Moreover, outcome-wide approaches will generally be more useful than exposure-wide approaches in shaping public health recommendations.",eng,0.744226882932195
1503262,M1342134,The epidemiology of genetic epidemiology.,"Familial aggregation for disease is important; strong familial risk factors must exist even if the increased risk to a relative of an affected individual is modest. It is in practice difficult, however, to conduct studies in genetic epidemiology which conform to strict epidemiological principles. For twin studies there are two major questions: Are twins 'no different' from the population on which inference is to be made? Are study twins 'no different' to twins in the population? The importance of each question of bias depends on the scientific question, the trait(s) studied, and sampling issues. The strength of the twin design is its ability to refute the null hypothesis that genetic factors do not explain variation in a trait. Following the Popperian paradigm, alternate hypotheses should be considered in depth (both theoretically and empirically), with a design and sample size sufficient to exclude not just naive explanations. More sophisticated statistical techniques are now being applied, so the philosophy, assumptions, and limitations of statistical modelling must be appreciated. The concept of 'heritability' has, in the past, been misunderstood and misused. New advances in DNA technology promise to revolutionise epidemiological thinking, and so case-control-pedigree designs may well become standard tools. The strengths and limitations of studies based on related individuals as the sampling unit are discussed.",eng,0.7422676875049381

During a pilot study of 250 patients conducted over the first 2 years, a definite seasonal variation in the occurrence of gastro-enteritis, with a peak incidence in winter, was noticed, and this led to a more detailed study of 2,653 patients over the next 11 years. Bacterial pathogens were recovered from 27% of patients, strains of Shigella accounting for 12% Salmonella for 7% and Escherichia coli for 8%. A severe outbreak of E. coli infection occurred between October 1971 and December 1972, and 4 of a total of 9 deaths occurred during this period, all in children suffering from E. coli 0111/B4 infections. The bacterial recovery rate was highest in the summer (40%) and lowest in the winter (12%). Winter diarrhoea broke out over 3-month periods during each year and accounted for 37% of the cases, but none of the children who contracted it died. The clinical picture of winter diarrhoea differed from the others and the most serious illness was that caused by enteropathogenic strains of E. coli.

The results were compared with observations made by other authors. Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from both sick and healthy animals (mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs) as well as from veterinary staff were lysotyped with the international phage set for epidemiological investigations. The majority of the lysotypes demonstrated in sick mice and rats belonged to lysogroup III (77% and 96% respectively). S. aureus strains with the phage patterns III 6/42E/47/53/54/75/83A/ +, III 54/83A and III 54/83A/85 were most common amongst these animals. The lysotype 80/3c/47/53/54/75/84/85 + occurred in rabbits and guinea pigs only. S. aureus strains of lysogroup I and II, which are frequently involved in skin infections of man, were either found only very scarcely or not at all discovered in the animals tested. Among the veterinary personnel staphylococcal strains of the lysogroups I and III as well as non-classificable strains occurred at a similar rate of approximately 25% each. Several lysotypes (I 29, III 42E/47/53/54/75/77/84/ + M 187) persisted in members of the staff over a stretch of two to three years without causing infection to the animals under their charge. On the other hand, lysotypes isolated from infection sites (abscesses) in the animals were mostly found also in swabs from the nasopharynx of healthy animals and the personnel. The implications of the importation and the spreading of Staphylococci in animal stocks by veterinary staff are pointed out.
