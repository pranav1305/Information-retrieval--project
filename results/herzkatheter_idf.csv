1159864,M997705,Ein Prozessrechnersystem für Herzkatheterlabor und Hämodynamikmessplätze,"In cooperation with the Department of Electronic Data Processing Systems we have developed a data processing unit for the analysis of hemodynamic data at the Department of Internal Medicine I. The aim was to design a computer-system for the daily routine in heart-catheterizations as well as for the solution of scientific problems during hemodynamic studies. In the on-line-mode besides the ECG up to four pressures can be analysed simultaneously. Analog and digital tapes can also be processed off-line on demand. The concept of the whole system and the individual steps of computer-handling are adjusted to the problems of data-analysis in praxis from the viewpoint of the examining cardiologist. Since the system is interactive after each measurement and each given command the computer-results are displayed on the video-scope. Because of the modular structure of the program new medical criteria can easily be implemented at any time. Since the computer-system is not effectively used with only one cath-lab other units possibly of different hard-ware configuration can be connected simultaneously to the computer. Each cath-lab shares 16 K out of the total 32 K core-memory. The results are displayed graphically and alpha-numerically on video-scope, x-y-plotter and line printer. The sampling-rate for fluid-filled catheters is 200 Hz and for catheter-tip-manometers 400 Hz. Smothing and differentiation-procedures are adapted to the respective catheter-material. The computer-program calibrates the different pressure amplifiers automatically. After defining the catheter-position the pressure-signals are sampled for 10 s and immediately afterwards analyzed by the computer. The ECG and the corresponding pressure-curves are displayed on the video-scope. The automatically selected representative beat as well as each of the identified and numerated other beats of the sampling-phase can be displayed selectively together with its numerical results. The computer marks the positions within the pressure-curves, where the individual measurements were taken. Besides the systolic and diastolic pressures in valvular stenosis the maximal and mean systolic or diastolic gradients, ejection- or filling-period, valve-flow and valve-area are calculated autonomously. The calculation of cardiac-output, different volume-indices and stroke-work-index are based on Fick-method, thermo- or indicator-dilution technique. The contractility-parameters max dp/dt, t-max dp/dt, max dp/dt/DP, max dp/dt/P, VPM, V40, min dp/dt and the stiffness are computed for the left and on demand also for the right ventricle. Data of the patient and the operating-team, catheter-technique, complications and free comments are transmitted to the computer via terminal together with the actual time. The computer-system was drafted for permanent use. Therefore possible technical defects have been anticipated in the design of hard- and soft-ware. In cases of failure suitable steps allow the immediate restart of the system without loosing information...",ger,0.9120077177067006

Ein Erfahrungsbericht über 497 Katheter in 5 Jahren.,"Background and methods!#!Central catheters are an important prerequisite for adequate parenteral nutrition in preterm infants. However, a variety of complications have been shown to be associated with central lines: septicemica, thrombotic complications, mechanical complications. In this retrospective analysis we summarize our recent experience with central silastic catheters.!##!Results!#!Within a five-year-period (1986-1990). 497 silastic-catheters were inserted in 366 high risk neonates (mean birthweight 1360 g; 1060-1740 g, 25.-75. percentile) treated at the NICU, Department of Pediatrics, University of Göttingen. 451 catheters which were placed in a central position, were removed after an average duration of 11 days (mean; 8-18 days, 25.-75. percentile). During the observation period, 62.8 percent of the catheters were purposely removed. Making use of the Kaplan-Meier-curve, we calculated how long the catheter could stay without complications; 50% of all catheters could be expected to be in place for 25 days. The incidence of septicemia was 1.9%, bacterial contamination of the catheters was evident in 22% of all central lines. The most predominant microorganisms responsible for catheter-contamination were coagulase-negative staphylococci. In addition, catheters were removed because of signs of phlebitis or suspected thrombotic complications (11.1%), and mechanical complications (dislocation, occlusion; 11.7%). Due to malposition of the central catheter two preterm infants developed pericardial effusions. There was no correlation between the site where the catheter was inserted and these complications.!##!Conclusion!#!Central silastic catheters wherever clinically indicated are a valuable adjunct in the parenteral nutrition on high risk neonates.",ger,0.8396142578645349

This study reports on the experience with a group of 89 patients with 100 heart valve prostheses who were examined by spin-echo MR and gradient-echo MR. MR examination was performed in all patients without complications. The spin-echo sequence showed advantages in the depiction of anatomical structures like paravalvular abscesses. Anatomical structures adjacent to the artificial valve were clearly visible and the metal components of the valves showed no or only small artifacts. Artifacts were accentuated when using gradient-echo sequences. Gradient-echo sequences provided valuable information regarding the presence of valvular insufficiency. Physiological valvular regurgitation was easy to differentiate from pathological paravalvular or transvalvular regurgitation. These results demonstrate that patients with artificial valve prostheses can be imaged by MR without risk and that prosthesis-induced artifacts do no interfere with image interpretation.",ger,0.8121159290388509

The apex of the right ventricle represents a ""locus minoris resistentiae"" for a perforation because of its thin wall and frequent infiltration of fat with relaxation of the small muscle bundle. An analysis of 41 heart perforations by central venous catheters and 47 by transvenous pacemakers from the literature demonstrates the particularly high mortality of the perforation by a central venous catheter referring to the possible production of hydropericardium.

1926275,M1765344,Kardiologische Diagnostik bei arteriellen Embolien.,"Potential cardiac sources of arterial embolism are in particular thrombi within the left atrium or ventricle, or attached to a prosthetic valve, intracardiac tumors, and vegetations due to endocarditis. Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect may lead to paradoxical embolism, and spontaneous echo contrast within the heart has to be considered as a parameter of increased thromboembolic risk. In rare cases, atrial septal aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse or annulus calcification and calcified aortic stenosis has to be taken into consideration. Current method of choice for diagnosis of these abnormalities is echocardiography. When the transthoracic approach fails, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) leads to a definite diagnosis in most cases. Precordial echocardiography allows the detection of left ventricular thrombi with a sensitivity ranging between 72 and 95%, and monoplane TEE does usually not increase these numbers. In contrast, thrombi within the left atrium and particularly in the left atrial appendage can be detected with a significantly higher detection rate when TEE is used. The same is true for spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium, a phenomenon which is almost exclusively diagnosed by TEE, as well as for endocarditis associated vegetations that can be identified by TEE with a sensitivity higher than 90%. Patient foramen ovale is usually diagnosed by precordial contrast echocardiography combined with a Valsalva maneuver; color Doppler or contrast TEE allows to increase the detection rate. In the diagnosis of prosthetic valve attached thrombi and vegetations, TEE is clearly superior compared to the precordial examination, at least concerning prosthetic devices in mitral position. If echocardiography fails to identify a potential cardiac source of embolism, other techniques don't add significant information in most cases. Detection of a potential source of embolism, however, does not necessarily prove that the particular finding represents the true etiology of an embolic event; results of all clinical and technical examinations have to be evaluated in a critical synopsis. In addition, proper therapeutic consequences in quite a number of abnormalities considered as potential cardiac sources of embolism are not yet defined.",ger,0.8027111613855485

1692810,M1531772,Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for transplant renal artery stenosis.,"A recent report has challenged the efficacy and safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS). From January 1983 to December 1990, 24 PTA procedures were performed for TRAS in 18 patients. The stenoses were anastomotic in two cases, in the main renal artery in 14, and segmental in eight. After PTA, the residual stenosis was less than 20% in 14 (58%), 20%-50% in four (17%), and greater than 50% in six (25%). The mean diastolic blood pressure decreased from 106 mm Hg 1 day prior to PTA to 82 mm Hg 1 day after PTA. Long-term follow-up mean diastolic blood pressure (at 2-32 months) was 93 mm Hg (P less than .01). Eleven of the 18 patients (63%) had a 10% or greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure on long-term follow-up. Major complications occurred in two patients; one groin hematoma required surgical evacuation, and one polar infarct led to hypertension that was difficult to control. No surgical revisions of the transplant renal artery were necessary. The authors' data indicate that PTA should remain the treatment of choice for nonanastomotic TRAS.",eng,0.7520546178240629

1702484,M1541446,Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.,"Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is now practised worldwide and offered to patients as a viable alternative to coronary artery bypass graft surgery or pharmacological therapy. However, despite its undoubted popularity, there is still a substantial amount of mystery surrounding this treatment modality. Firstly, we really don't know how it ""works"" or, why it ""works"" in some patients and not in others; secondly, we're not quite certain how to describe the impact of treatment with PTCA on the beneficiary insert; by the effect on the lesion itself as measured by coronary angiography, or by the effect on coronary blood flow, which is also measurable by various techniques, or by the effect on myocardial perfusion which can also be ""objectively assessed"", or indeed, by its impact on the well-being of the patient, which cannot actually be measured, but is the primary aim of the treatment as offered to the patient - since there is no evidence supporting a beneficial effect for PTCA on longevity (unlike CABG in certain patient subgroups). Thirdly, similar difficulties exist regarding the assessment of the long-term benefit of PTCA, which are further compounded by the variable response, over time, of the vessel wall to balloon dilatation, a process known as ""restenosis"", or the ""Achilles heel"". The main difficulties in this area are that: a) the pathology of the process is poorly understood, and much mystery and doubt still lingers, b) there is no universal agreement on how to define ""restenosis"", c) although angiography appears to be the best widely available descriptive technique, many investigators continue to use antiquated analysis methodology, the inaccuracy of which has been frequently and conclusively demonstrated. Fourthly, the introduction of new devices, instead of bringing answers or solutions, has further compounded the problem, by thus far failing to reduce restenosis, while increasing the armimentarium, and therefore, ""the doctor's dilemma"". In this treatise we present the pathological theory of restenosis and its clinical correlations, we identify the difficulties in its assessment, and propose our solution to this significant aspect of the problem. We provide an extensive summary of pharmacological attempts to prevent restenosis, a description of the new devices and their potential role, as well as a though for the future.",eng,0.7493617511251048
1603540,M1442481,Long-term follow-up after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with single-vessel disease.,"Seven hundred ninety-eight patients with symptomatic single-vessel disease who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) between 1977 and 1985 were reevaluated by questionnaire 78 +/- 23 months after dilatation. Indication for PTCA was stenosis of > or = 70%, anginal symptoms, and objective signs of myocardial ischemia. The immediate success rate was 81.2%, and severe complications occurred in 7.1%, which included two fatal complications (0.3%). Repeat angiograms were performed in 582 of 648 patients who underwent successful dilatation and showed restenosis in 143 cases (24.6%). Within 1 year after the first dilatation, 586 patients had been successfully revascularized by PTCA (i.e., there was no evidence of restenosis or redilatation was successful), and 113 patients had undergone bypass surgery. The remaining 99 patients were treated medically if PTCA was unsuccessful or if restenosis (> or = 70%) that was not amenable to redilatation was present. The 8-year overall survival probability was 91.7%, and cardiac survival was 95.5%. The 8-year event-free survival probability was 52.7% for all patients: 62.5% in patients who had successful PTCA and 14.5% in patients who had unsuccessful PTCA (p = 0.0000). The cardiac survival probabilities of patients with lasting PTCA success at 1 year and of surgically treated patients were significantly better than those of patients who did not have successful revascularization (at 8 years 97.2% and 98.1% vs 88.9%; p < 0.04). Late events (> or = 1 year) occurred more often in patients who did not have successful revascularization compared with patients who had successful PTCA (at 8 years 57.9% were event-free vs 74.4%; p < 0.0001); even fewer late events were observed in surgically treated patients (at 8 years 88.2% were event-free; p < 0.004). Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis revealed left ventricular ejection fraction and revascularization status at 1 year as determinants of overall, cardiac, infarct-free, and event-free survival probabilities. At the time of reevaluation significantly more patients in the successful PTCA subgroup were still free of symptoms or had experienced improvement than patients in the bypass or medical subgroups (86.8% vs 68.9% and 59.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001), and more patients in the successful PTCA subgroup were still working (75.4% vs 53.3% and 56.9%, respectively; p < 0.001).

Nine patients demonstrated angiographic improvement following the procedure, and 7 showed immediate clinical improvement. On one occasion angioplasty precipitated graft loss. Five patients underwent planned corrective surgery, 4 after unsuccessful angioplasties. Our experience suggests that PTA should be the first method of intervention for TAS.

Prior to PTA, a renogram during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril was performed, but the result did not influence the decision to treat. The parenchymal time activity curves were judged by visual interpretation. Of the 94 patients, 51 had unilateral and 43 bilateral RAS. In 17 patients with bilateral RAS, PTA could be performed only in the least affected kidney; because of this the effect of PTA on their blood pressure could not be evaluated. Of the remaining 77 patients, a positive captopril renogram was seen in all 31 cured patients, in 22 of the 27 patients with improvement, and in six of the 19 patients with no change of their blood pressure. The sensitivity of the tests for cure and improvement of the blood pressure was 91% (53/58 patients) for all patients, 95% in patients with unilateral RAS (35/37), and 86% (18/21 patients) in patients with bilateral RAS, bilaterally treated. In 18 patients with a negative captopril renogram the blood pressure improved in five, and did not change in 13 patients. The success of PTA in patients with a negative captopril renogram was so poor that we feel it would have been better not to have performed angiography and PTA at all.

This represents 93% of all venous catheterizations of the right side of the heart and 97% of all arterial catheterizations of the left side of the heart in the pediatric age range. One hundred and ninety-five patients (29% of the group) weighed 5 kg or less and 133 (20% of the group) were neonates. There were virtually no complications following the venous studies. The complication rate following percutaneous arterial studies is lower than is the reported experience with cut-down arteriotomies. Long-term survival following percutaneous atrial balloon septostomy in D-transposition of the great arteries was comparable to that following cut-down balloon septostomy. The ease of accomplishment, significantly lower complication rate, and successful accomplishment of atrial balloon septostomy prompt us to advocate that the percutaneous technique of cardiac catheterization be extended to include the neonate and young infant who weighsless than 5 kg.",eng,0.742204696520981

148128,M27601322,Endovascular treatment of pediatric intracranial arteriovenous shunt.,"Intracranial arteriovenous shunts (ICAVS) in young children are characterized by frequent high-flow fistulas. In association with high-flow fistulas and the physiological condition of the developing brain and heart, each ICAVS type tends to present at a certain age with unique symptoms. Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) and dural sinus malformation with arteriovenous (AV) shunt tend to present in the neonate with high output cardiac failure. In infancy, VGAM, pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and infantile dural AVF (DAVF) tend to present with hydrodynamic disorder such as macrocephaly, ventriculomegaly, prominent facial veins, and developmental delay. Pial AVF, AV malformation, and infantile DAVF can present with focal neurological signs such as seizure or hemorrhage at older ages. Endovascular treatment is currently the first choice of treatment for most pediatric ICAVS. The treatment goal should be defined on a patient-by-patient basis, according to the unique physiological condition of the child.",eng,0.7416909888091802
599775,M424606,Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of renovascular hypertension.,"Four patients with typical renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic stenosis (3 patients) and near occlusion (one patient) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Two patients had malignant hypertension by clinical standards. All had significant reduction in blood pressure following angioplasty, resulting in either a normotensive state, or management with significantly less antihypertensive medication. Patency and normal renin levels were achieved within two months in 2 patients. Clinical follow-up documented continued reduction in blood pressure. Advantages of the procedure include local anesthesia, relatively little discomfort, repeatability, and the fact that surgery is not precluded if angioplasty is unsuccessful.",eng,0.7416336733921426

They are usually found after radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease and carcinoma of the breast. Although histologically there may be diffuse fibrosis involving the endocardium, myocardium and pericardium, it is pericarditis which is the usual clinical feature. It often occurs late, and takes many forms. The dry constrictive fibrous type of pericarditis is the most severe because of the amount of myocardial fibrosis usually associated with it. It is rare for there to be clinical features of myocardial fibrosis, and if present they are variable: isolated disorders of repolarisation or of conduction, or true cardiomyopathies. Lesions of the coronary arteries are exceptionally rare after radiotherapy, and involve fibrosis of the intima or atherosclerosis.",fre,0.7050860548964584

With this technique bullous lesions could be excised in 10 cases and pleurodesis could be performed in all patients. Morbidity and mortality were nil. The cosmetic and functional advantages of video-thoracoscopy were obvious. Long-term results remain to be evaluated. This technique has shown that it is possible in all cases to create pleurodesis (pleural poudrage or pleurectomy) and to treat parenchymatous lesions (excision of bullous systems). This suggests that the long-term results will be the same as those obtained with conventional surgery.",fre,0.6928642437092024

On the basis of a series of 25 cases, we propose in these serious forms the following therapeutic escalation: very high dose corticotherapy, with betamethasone at 0.12 to 0.48 mg/kg/day for 15 days, followed by a degressive treatment over 6 weeks to 3 months; intubation to overcome a difficult stage in the event of aggravation of the angioma with a rhinopharyngitis. Embolization and the use of the laser proved unsatisfactory in the extensive forms of angiomas. In the event of failure of the preceding treatment, we perform a tracheotomy, the duration of which can be reduced by the surgical exeresis of the angioma with a widening of the larynx.",fre,0.6901803161174545
