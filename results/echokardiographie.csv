1127032,M964829,Echokardiographie,Echocardiography makes possible the analysis of cardiac structures and their dynamics. The presence of valvular disease and its severity can be determined by evaluation of variations in the intensity of reflection and alterations in the motion of valvular structures. The echocardiographic representation of cardiac chambers permits the detection of congenital and acquired structural defects as well as an evaluation of ventricular function. Echocardiography provides a non-invasive means of diagnostic analysis throughout the spectrum of heart diseases and can replace a number of invasive diagnostic procedures.,ger,1.0

1080809,M918587,Die Echokardiographie in der Beurteilung der Ventrikelfunktion.,"The ultrasonic beam used for quantitative assessment of left ventricular (LV) function traverses the heart in a projection similar to the familiar angiographic left anterior oblique projection. It crosses the anterior wall of the right ventricle, the right ventricular cavity, the interventricular septum, the LV cavity and the posterior wall of the left ventricle. Whereas the cyclic changes of the right ventricular diameter are rarely clearly determined by echocardiography, the easily assessed cyclic changes of the LV endocardial transverse diameter are useful measure of LV FUNCTION. Of practical importance are the percentage of systolic shortening of the LV diameter (%Sh) and the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF). There are several factors, such as placing of the ultrasonic transducer, the shape and size of the LV cavity and rotational movements of the heart as a whole, that influence echocardiographic determination of the transverse LV diameter. In patients with asynergic contraction, %Sh and VCF cannot be used as measures of overall LV performance, but localized contraction disturbances of the septum and the posterior wall may be detected from the reduced extent of wall motion in a given LV segment during a full sweep from the base to the apex. The most important indications for echocardiographic assessment of LV function are valvar diseases with chronic LV pressure or volume overload, and congestive cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography has proved useful in serial evaluation of LV function in patients undergoing valvar heart surgery. Assessment of LV volume by standard echocardiography using the cubic formula is not satisfactory. More accurate determination of volumes is provided by formulas that include the actual ratio of the LV long axis to the minor axis.",ger,0.896024662724564

The close anatomic vicinity of the transducer to the heart and thoracic aorta allows the use of high frequency devices with better resolution compared to transthoracic echocardiography. Furthermore, the diagnostic gain when evaluating structures that are poorly visualized by the transthoracic approach such as the left atrial appendage, interatrial septum, prosthetic valves and the thoracic aorta is highly improved by TEE. Major indications for TEE include the search for a cardiac source of embolism and cardiac tumors, the work-up prior to balloon mitral valvuloplasty, the evaluation of prosthetic valves and the search for vegetations and aortic dissection. After a short summary of patient preparation, instrumentation and examination technique, the major indications, contraindications and complications are reviewed on the basis of our own experience and the literature.",ger,0.8827895431022612

The complete circle of Willis was investigated in all patients during headache-free intervals. TCD investigations were repeated in 10 patients during a migraine attack, in one patient twice. Based on the diagnostic criteria of the ""headache classification committee of the international headache society"" 23 patients were assigned to a ""migraine without aura"" group and 17 to a ""migraine with aura"" group. Twenty age-matched volunteers, not suffering from headache or any vascular disease, served as a control group. No significant differences were detected between the hemodynamic data of the control group and the migraine groups both with respect to the headache-free interval and the attack.

Normal patients had laminar Doppler auditory signals and time interval histogram flow patterns because right pulmonary artery turbulence was not present during systole or diastole. Patients with pulmonary valvar stenosis had turbulence during systole only. In all nine postoperative patients with surgical shunts, turbulent systolic and diastolic time interval histograms and abnormal auditory signals were present. A typical shunt murmur was not audible to auscultation in six of the postsurgical patients at the time of the study. Suprasternal range-gated pulsed Doppler echocardiography affords an accurate, safe and simple noninvasive bedside means for confirming shunt patency in patients who have undergone surgical systemic artery to pulmonary artery anastomoses.",eng,0.7741722720887604
863213,M688146,Detection of pericardial effusion by chest roentgenography and electrocardiography versus echocardiography.,"To determine the sensitivity and specificity of chest roentgenography and electrocardiography in the detection of pericardial effusion, echocardiography was used as the diagnostic standard. Chest roentgenograms and electrocardiograms of 124 patients, 57 of whom had pericardial effusion, were read without knowledge of the echocardiographic interpretation. The sensitivity of roentgenographic diagnosis was low (20%), as was that of diagnosis from decreased voltage on the electrocardiogram (26%). The specificity of the chest roentgenogram was 89% and that of the low-voltage electrocardiogram 97%. The high specificity of the low-voltage electrocardiogram may have been due in part to the exclusion of obese and emphysematous subjects from the study. When cardiomegaly detected roentgenographically or a low-voltage electrocardiogram or both were considered as evidence of pericardial effusion, sensitivity improved to 82% but specificity declined to 29%. It is concluded the chest roentgenography and electrocardiography are unsatisfactory as screening investigations for the detection of pericardial effusion.",eng,0.7740168480547247

In normals aortic blood velocity rose rapidly in early systole to a midsystolic peak then fell to zero velocity. These roughly parabolic patterns had area ratios beneath the first and second halves of the curves measuring 52:48 +/- 3 (SD). With increasingly severe mitral regurgitation the pattern became skewed leftward such that the percent in the first half of systole ranged from 53-79%. From the angiograms of our sixteen patients an estimate of true percent regurgitation was made using the Fick cardiac output and ventricular volume measurements. When compared with the area under the first half of the velocity curve a strong correlation was found (r = 0.84) indicating that this Doppler technique can be used to evaluate mitral insufficiency.",eng,0.7735922738451033

MRA included both 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences. Internal and external carotid artery origins were graded normal, mild, moderate, severe, or critical stenosis, or complete occlusion by each of the three studies.!##!Results!#!Spearman rank correlations of both internal and external carotid artery grades were 0.85 (MRA and XRA), 0.69 (MRA and US), and 0.73 (XRA and US). For internal carotid artery origins only, the correlations were 0.94 (MRA and XRA), 0.85 (MRA and US), and 0.82 (XRA and US). Of discrepancies in internal carotid artery interpretation greater than one grade, seven resulted from US error, three from MRA error, and one from XRA error. A 2-cm partially thrombosed aneurysm detected by US and MRA was missed by XRA. Of 16 possible ulcers on XRA, 11 were noted by MRA, none by US.!##!Conclusions!#!MRA and XRA are similar in assessment of carotid bifurcation stenosis. MRA, like US, permits direct visualization of plaque. This preliminary study suggests that MRA may be used to clarify equivocal findings of US, or replace XRA in presurgical planning.",eng,0.7687466541138185

Cerebral arteriography was performed in 74 patients. Transient ischemic attack was the most common indication for study (30%). The OPG was normal in 95% of cases in which the diameter of the lumen of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was less than 60% reduced; the ocular pulse was delayed in 86% of cases with ICA stenosis of 60% or more. The overall diagnostic accuracy of OPG was 93%; CPA did not enhance the accuracy of OPG alone. Supraorbital Doppler tests detected 88% of cases of ICA stenosis of 60% or more, but there was a 13% false-positive rate with ICA stenosis of less than 60%. Supratrochlear Doppler tests had only a 1% false-positive rate, but detected only 48% of significant ICA stenoses. Doppler studies were most often abnormal in the presence of ICA occlusion. Thus, OPG was as sensitive as supraorbital Doppler and more sensitive than supratrochlear Doppler in detecting hemodynamically significant ICA stenoses, without the unacceptable false-positive rate observed with the supraorbital Doppler test.",eng,0.7639674726773749

Construction d'un nomogramme.,"Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of mitral stenosis is often difficult in patients with atrial fibrillation. Sixteen patients were examined by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and the relation between the variations in transmitral end diastolic pressure gradient and the length of the corresponding cardiac cycles was analysed. Mitral valve surface area (1.65 +/- 0.73 cm2) was determined by the pressure half-time method. The end diastolic transmitral pressure gradient was calculated from the simplified Bernouilli formula applied to end diastolic mitral flow velocity. In each patient, a linear relationship was observed between the end diastolic mitral gradient and the corresponding RR interval. The slope and intercept of the graph correlated significantly to mitral valve surface area (r = 0.72, p < 0.002 and r = 0.93, p < 0.00001, respectively). Using regression equations describing these correlations, it has been possible to construct a nomogramme indicating mitral valve surface area as a function of mitral end diastolic pressure gradient and the duration of the corresponding RR cycle. This nomogramme facilitates Doppler evaluation of mitral stenosis in atrial fibrillation.",fre,0.7411546794983939

It appeared likely that the presence of an ICA stenosis plays a role in the presence of a contralateral bruit where a contralateral stenosis or occlusion are present. 4. An ipsilateral bruit was present in 50/50 ICA occlusions. A contralateral bruit was present in 7 patients the ICA angiogram being normal. A bruit was present on both sides in 4 patients and it may be that some patients are somewhat apt to have bruits. 5.
