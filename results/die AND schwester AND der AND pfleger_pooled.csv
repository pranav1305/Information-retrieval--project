Between primiparae, secundiparae, and multiparae, working and housewife mothers, workers, farmerettes, women doing other jobs, and academically trained women, eutrophic mature and hypertrophic mature neonates, and newly born male and female babies there was observed a roughly similar frequency of the generally accepted ""normal weight of placenta"" of 400 g to 600 g and no significance of minor differences in frequency, respectively. 2. The high incidence of mothers aged 20 and less in the ""normal placental weight group"" of 400 g to 600 g compared to 21- to 30-year-old and 31- to 35-year-old mothers was not found to be significant. 3. The high incidence of unmarried mothers in the ""normal placental weight group"" of 400 g to 600 g compared to married mothers is not significant, the higher incidence of premature labor in unmarried women being due possibly, not to the weight of placenta, but rather primiparity, age under 20, and social class. 4. The higher frequency in the placental weight group up to and including 400 g of married compared to unmarried mothers, primiparae compared to secundiparae, primiparae and secundiparae compared to multiparae, working mothers compared to housewife mothers, and workers and farmerettes compared to both women doing other types of jobs and academically trained women was not found to be significant.",ger,0.8245779918481123

Two groups of scoliotic and nonscoliotic children were examined with selected psychological tests. No differences could be found in regard to neuroticism, extraversion, manifest fear or the children's self-image. Differences were found in regard to the social environment which scoliotic children experienced as more demanding and supportive. As a result they were more concerned with achievement in a performance situation and more confident of success. The type and extent of the psychological effects of scoliosis is determined by the position accorded to the children by the social environment. Negative consequences can best be dealt with by educating the parents.",ger,0.8217978749583041

7,198877,M14648,An experimental and clinical pharmacological study of the influence of triamterene on the diuretic and saluretic properties of furosemide xantinol.,"The diuretic and saluretic effect of furosemide xantinol administered alone and mixed with different amounts of 2,4,7-triamino-6-phenylpteridine (triamterene) have been investigated in rat and man. The presence of triamterene resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of furosemide xantinol induced diuresis in both species. It was necessary to reduce the amount of triamterene present in the mixture to approximately half that of the one theoretically required according to considerations of the recommended therapeutic doses of the two diuretics before significant inhibition was avoided. Nevertheless, this reduced amount of triamterene proved sufficient to inhibit the distal tubular exchange of Na+ for K+ and H+ and a mixture formulated to give the ratio of 40 mg furosemide xantinol (as base) plus 25 mg triamterene (Salidur) was shown to produce a smooth but efficient loss of water and Na+ in the absence of detectable kaliuresis or reduction in urinary pH, thereby reducing the usual risk of inducing hypokalaemic alkalosis.",ger,0.8161790321800704

The structure of the family in childhood showed significant differences concerning patients with different social contacts and different diagnoses. Patients who grew up in big families have themselves a relatively large number of children and vice versa (p less than 0,01).

We investigated how mixed and redundant information carried by neuroreceptors could be efficiently coded by output neurons in the second neuronal layer in the brain. We showed that a good discrimination is yielded if neuroreceptors that terminate on the same output neuron belong to several types, if these types are in different proportions for each output neuron, and if each output neuron exerts an action on all others so that their independence is maximized, according to the Jutten and Hérault algorithm for separating linear mixtures of independent sources. The proposed model details the computations made by neurons and leads to a better understanding of several observed properties of the olfactory system, among which the inhibitory actions of local neurons of the second layer and the identifiability of insect glomeruli.",fre,0.7881414352933661

Children in Canada experienced a greater decrease in mortality during this period than did all children in the United States. In particular, while mortality rates for both boys and girls in Canada were higher than those for White children in the United States in 1971, in 1989 the rates for Canadian children were lower. Seniors in Canada experienced a similar or lesser reduction in age-specific mortality than did seniors in the United States. Even though senior women in the United States experienced a reduction in mortality comparable to that of senior women in Canada, Canadian senior women in general had lower level of mortality than their counterparts in the United States. Senior men in the United States experienced a relatively greater reduction than did their counterparts in Canada. The greater decline in mortality for senior men in the United States enabled them to catch up with the lower level of mortality for their Canadian counterparts in 1989. These general conclusions apply whether we compare the Canadian experience to that of the entire population or the White population in the United States. These trends in mortality reductions may reflect the fact that free universal Medicare is available for all ages in Canada, while most publicly-funded Medicare entitlements begin at age 65 in the United States.",fre,0.775453461275224

To quote George Jasper Wherrett in the Miracle of the Empty Beds: One hundred years ago the word consumption (as tuberculosis was then called) struck horror in human hearts. Today, in the western world, it barely evokes any emotion save a too easy surprise that it still exists. This statistical chronicle of tuberculosis in Canada is divided into two parts. Part I: From the Era of Sanatorium Treatment to the Present pulls together data from yellowed-with-age reports on tuberculosis and vital statistics, historical accounts, and modern computer files, to document the changes in tuberculosis incidence and mortality over past decades to the present. Part II: Risk Today and Control takes a closer look at those most vulnerable to contracting tuberculosis. It also looks at the future, the need for maintaining and, indeed, strengthening vigilance, and the work yet to be done to eradicate tuberculosis in Canada.

The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review was the privately owned older journal, and the American Journal of Nursing was the voice of the professional organization. Each journal was edited by a strong nursing leader, Janet Geister and Mary Roberts, respectively. Each editor had many years of service to the nursing profession in varied capacities. Naturally, each had distinctly different interests, visions, and styles of communication. These editors witnessed and commented on the change in the sphere of nursing practice from a private duty and public health orientation to one that eventually became dominated by the hospital. Although their approaches differed, both recognized the need for organization, versatility, and creative problem solving. However, the legacy of these leaders must be considered in view of the gap that continues to exist between practicing nurses and the American Nurses' Association leadership.",eng,0.7270658149129213

Overchallenging of the functional capacity of the parathyroid gland may evoke an insufficiency of the parathyroid gland which on its part induces a fetal secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the early diagnostic recognition of the insufficiency of the parathyroid gland is of importance, since (also in basic diseases known before pregnancy) now special therapeutic conditions are given. Maternal hyperparathyroidism leads to fetal hypoprarthyroidism with resulting developmental disturbances; it furthers the tendency to abortions and perinatal mortality. Epidemiological prospective investigations have shown that among the identified cases of oligo- or asymptomatic functional disturbances of the parathyroid glands there are very often women at an age, when they are capable of bearing children. This statement confirms the postule regularly to control serum calcium content during pregnancy. Objectifying the disturbed integrity of the calcium metabolism, therapeutic measures are necessary, the details of which are demonstrated according to own experiences. In such cases the cooperation between the gynaecologist being in charge of the pregnant woman and the internist working in the field of endocrinology is to be wished.",ger,0.7974584755568621

In 1952 the incidence of tuberculosis amounted to 490 per 1000 000 of the population; the prevalence to 1400. The mortality rate was 105.8 in 1950. In 1974 the incidence rate has been reduced to 81.4 (among them 49.4 excretors of tubercle bacilli), the prevalence rate was only 248.9 (among them 78.3 with excretion of tubercle bacilli and 11.7 with chronic tuberculosis--persons excreting tubercle bacilli for more than 2 years). The mortality rate from tuberculosis amounted to 13.8 at this time. The most sensible reduction of all indices was found among children 0-14 years old. Tuberculosis in Poland is still a problem of medico-social importance in adults and before all in old people, being that part of the population in past times only in a low degree vaccinated or revaccinated and in a higher degree exposed to severe infections with tubercle bacilli. The comprehensive complex programme of tuberculosis control passed by the Sejm of the Polish People's Republic, includes three approaches since 1960: the epidemiological, the integrating and the phthisiopneumological direction. Prerequisites for the scheduled realisation of the programme are the case-finding as early as possible, the quick and correct diagnosis and the immediate onset of a specific treatment, further on the dispensary care of all contacts of the patient (his surroundings) and optimal prophylactic measures against tuberculosis.",ger,0.7931858169205175

Part 1: Effects of pH and buffer systems.,"The stability of phenothiazines is affected by the pH-value of the solution. At the pH-values of maximum stability, triflupromazine hydrochloride and chlorpromazine hydrochloride are more stable than promazine hydrochloride. The stability of chlorpromazine hydrochloride in the Sörensen's phosphate buffer is slightly higher than that in the McIlvaine's citric acid-phosphate buffer system. On the other hand, the stbility of promazine hydrochloride and triflupromazine hydrochloride in the latter buffer system is slightly higher than that in the former one.",ger,0.7821098935585273

Views of surviving spouse on effects of the service on the patient.,"The surviving spouses of 34 patients who died of cancer at St Christopher's Hospice have been interviewed about 13 months after the patient's death. The information given is compared with that obtained from 34 spouses of patients dying from cancer in other hospitals and matched with the St Christopher's group. Patients at St Christopher's were less often thought to have suffered severe pain and other distress than at other hospitals, but pain relief was not bought at the cost of drug-induced confusion and patients at St Christopher's remained more mobile than at other hospitals. Hospice patients were more aware of chapel services and prayers than at other hospitals. None was said to have been upset by these and 66% were glad of them. Despite the frequency of deaths in the Hospice, patients at St Christopher's were no more likely to be thought to have been 'upset' by such events than patients elsewhere or to have found their interactions with other patients anything but helpful.",eng,0.7082260228593338

The variable attachment to pets was also tested and assessed as a mediator of this relationship. A positive relationship between adolescents' communication with their significant other (mother, father, and best friend) and quality of life decreased when controlling for attachment to dogs. In cat owners, a positive relationship between communication with a best friend and quality of life decreased when controlling for attachment to cats. In cat and dog owners, attachment to these pets predicted higher levels of quality of life. Higher attachment to dogs and cats was explained by good best friend (IV) and attachment to pets (DV) and best friends. Mediation effects of attachment to dogs and cats might be explained in terms of the caring activities associated with these types of pets.",eng,0.7017784730399894

Earlier contacts with the health service, social background, parents' morbidity, general discussion and recommendations.","Psychological factors were considered by the examining physicians to play an important part in 5.2% of approximately 4 000 initial visits to a paediatric clinic. These cases are compared with a matched control group representing the cases where the physicians judged that psychological factors were not involved. As compared with the controls, then a considerably larger proportion of the patients with symptoms associated with psychological factors had a previous history of contacts with child psychiatrists or attendence at the paediatric clinic for problems of a psychological nature. Their parents, the mothers in particular, had a higher frequency of registered sickness for mental-nervous disorders and their families had more frequently been the subject of special social inquiries or assistance. To a large extent the examining paediatrician was unaware of these background conditions. With a better case history and proper follow-up one could probably reduce the number of X-ray examinations, consultations and laboratory tests. Further training and better contacts would be facilitated if members of a children's psychiatric team were stationed within the paediatric clinic.",eng,0.7003942227400047
