Slaughter yield, amount of breast meat, and abdominal fat were determined at 6 wk of age in all groups and at a body weight of 2,360 g for males and 1,965 g for females in the low- and normal-temperature groups, and at 8 wk in the high-temperature groups. Temperature, genotype, and sex influenced both absolute and relative weights of carcass, breast meat, and abdominal fat. Temperature had a negative effect on breast meat yield. Males were affected more by high temperature than females. A significant interaction between temperature and sex for breast meat yield was caused by a low yield for males at the high temperature. A similar interaction for proportion of abdominal fat was caused by a high fat content in males reared at the high temperature. Slaughter yield and especially yield of breast meat were highest in FC chickens in all comparisons.",eng,0.7429341665224013,4

8,8,104772,M28295777,Can LDL cholesterol be too low? Possible risks of extremely low levels.,"Following the continuous accumulation of evidence supporting the beneficial role of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, therapeutic possibilities now exist to lower LDL-C to very low levels, similar to or even lower than those seen in newborns and nonhuman species. In addition to the important task of evaluating potential side effects of such treatments, the question arises whether extremely low LDL-C levels per se may provoke adverse effects in humans. In this review, we summarize information from studies of human cellular and organ physiology, phenotypic characterization of rare genetic diseases of lipid metabolism, and experience from clinical trials. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of the robustness of the regulatory systems that maintain balanced fluxes and levels of cholesterol at both cellular and organismal levels. Even at extremely low LDL-C levels, critical capacities of steroid hormone and bile acid production are preserved, and the presence of a cholesterol blood-brain barrier protects cells in the central nervous system. Apparent relationships sometimes reported between less pronounced low LDL-C levels and disease states such as cancer, depression, infectious disease and others can generally be explained as secondary phenomena. Drug-related side effects including an increased propensity for development of type 2 diabetes occur during statin treatment, whilst further evaluation of more potent LDL-lowering treatments such as PCSK9 inhibitors is needed. Experience from the recently reported and ongoing large event-driven trials are of great interest, and further evaluation including careful analysis of cognitive functions will be important.",eng,0.7362946627630602,2

18,18,1895329,M1734388,Nutrient adequacy of low fat intakes for children: the Bogalusa Heart Study.,"Nutritional adequacy is important when diets and dietary alterations are recommended for children. Concern is expressed that low fat intakes may have deleterious effects on growth and development and may be deficient in total calories and essential nutrients. In a study of the effect of variation in percent fat in the diet, a sample of 871 ten-year-olds was stratified according to four different fat intakes: less than 30% of total kilocalories (kcal), 30% to 35% kcal, 35% to 40% kcal, and greater than 40% kcal. The race/sex distribution was similar within each fat intake group. Fourteen percent of the sample had fat intakes less than 30% of total calories. The amount of calories from breakfast, dinner, and snacks was higher in the children with fat intakes greater than 40% of total calories than those with lower fat intakes. The energy intake of all race/sex groups fell within the recommended range. The low fat intake group was eating 25% less calories than the high fat intake group (1800 kcal vs 2400 kcal). The percentage of calories from carbohydrate, specifically sugar, was greater in the low fat intake group compared with the high fat intake group. Percentage of calories from protein was approximately 13% for all groups. Fiber and starch were the same across all fat intakes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",eng,0.7192243993293005,4

Micronutrient intakes of 553 Dutch (sub-) elite athletes were assessed using web-based 24-h dietary recalls with accompanying nutritional supplement questionnaires. In the majority of both users and non-users of dietary supplements, vitamin D intake was below the estimated average requirement (AR) if supplements were not included in the analysis. Including dietary supplements improved vitamin D intake, but still a part of the athletes, both men and women, reported an intake below the AR. Non-users of dietary supplements were particularly at risk for low intakes of vitamins B1, B2, B3 and vitamins A, C and selenium. Mean iron intake was reported below the AR in a substantial group of women, both users and non-users. The use of sport nutrition products contributed only slightly to micronutrient intake. A small prevalence of athletes using dietary supplements showed intakes of some micronutrients above the Upper Level. In conclusion, both users and non-users of nutritional supplements reported inadequate intake of micronutrients. For most micronutrients, use of nutritional supplements does not completely compensate for intakes below AR. Athletes should consider making better food choices and the daily use of a low-dosed multivitamin supplement.",eng,0.7187452525557241,4

Fluoride was measured in plasma and urine with a specific electrode and fluoride bioavailability from the three drugs was compared. Calcium absorption after oral load was assessed by measuring variations from the fasting state of plasma calcium and parathyroid hormone and of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio. The bioavailability of fluoride is significantly decreased by the association to sodium fluoride of hydroxyapatite but not of tri-calcium phosphate. Calcium absorption seems greater after administration of hydroxyapatite compound. The decrease of the fluoride bioavailability is probably dependent on the capacity of calcium absorption from the calcium salts. The association of calcium to fluoride is absolutely required for treatment of osteoporosis. The microcrystalline hydroxyapatite compound seems preferable in view of its greater calcium absorption and of its limited decrease in fluoride bioavailability.,fre,0.5493453314272112,3

The deficiency at the level of manual rapidity is the most important element concerning the motive debility of mentally handicapped children. The tests show that there is no parallelism between the motive retardedness and the level of attainment of the corporal schema. In fact, the motor debility of 8 years old children is emphasized at the age of 10 with reference to normal children. On the other hand, if, at the age of 8, the mentally handicapped children have a lag of the corporal schema acquisition, these children have nearly overcome their retardedness at the age of 10. Therefore one can conclude that the motor retardedness of the slightly mentally handicapped children is not essentially due to a deficiency of the corporal schema integration.",ger,0.548163823409605,1

During the reaction of mercaptanes, e.g. cysteine, homocysteine, cysteamine, with dansyl chloride, the corresponding disulfides are formed and dansyl chloride is reduced to 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene 1-sulfinic acid. This reaction is so rapid that the normal dansylation can take place only after complete oxidation of all SH-compounds. Therefore only the dansyl derivatives of the corresponding disulfides are formed during normal dansylation of SH-compounds. If different SH-compounds are present in the reaction mixture mixed disulfides are formed as well. These can be separated by microchromatography on 3 X 3 cm micropolyamide sheets. Dependent on the concentration of dansyl chloride, 6 or even 15 different dansylated disulfides are formed from three different SH-compounds so that interpretation of these chromatograms is difficult.

The mmHg is an international measurement unit; a new European grading system will make prescribing much more difficult; the degree of arterial insufficiency is calculated by taking systolic pressures by Doppler and is expressed in mmHg; in case of superimposition of elastic stocking, pressure add together but not grades; the unit used for pressure instruments is the mmHg; a clinical situation may require a compression force straddled between two grades; finally, new materials will certainly provide increasingly precise forces.",fre,0.5381011544970709,1

Rats rendered physically dependent on alcohol by the forced consumption of a liquid diet containing ethanol were subsequently placed in an intragastric self-administration situation. 2. Under these conditions, the intoxicated rats maintained the same high level of ethanol consumption as observed during the previous forced ingestion procedure. However this response is transitory and disappears following the presentation of a dilute ethanol solution. 3. Significantly different results were provided by the control animals. 4. Conditions for establishing a higher oral preference in rats rendered physically dependent are examined and discussed.",fre,0.5370705075941116,1

Safety of high titre measles vaccines.,"Unexpected results suggesting decreased survival when compared with standard titre vaccine administered at 9 months of age have been found in some field studies evaluating the performance of high titre measles vaccine. Analytical difficulties have arisen because the studies were not specifically designed to measure survival. Nonetheless, careful analysis of the results from all of the high titre vaccine trials showed decreased survival of high titre vaccine recipients, in areas with high background mortality rates, compared with recipients of standard measles vaccines at 9 months. No systematic biases could be found in the studies to explain these differences. Statistical analysis of these data suggested that the findings were unlikely to be attributable to chance alone. The panel recommended that high titre measles vaccine derived from the original Edmonston measles vaccine isolate should no longer be recommended for use in immunization programmes. Further post-licensure field studies of new measles vaccines should take into account the results of these studies. Additional detailed epidemiological studies in populations that have received high titre vaccines and their controls were encouraged.",fre,0.5350088764173812,1

During a first stage, the reproducibility of the test was determined this was excellent, 3.26% for the maximal flow rate and 2.48% for the maximum volume expired in one second. During a second stage were drawn up correlations between the two tests which were very narrow: O.971 in healthy sbjects, 0.919 in sick patients. The Wright flow meter is a strong, reliable and inexpensive instrument and will thus be very useful in the daily assessment of bronchiolar constriction at the bed side, and in the routine detection of obstructive syndromes.",fre,0.5344650203940944,1

The detected products are TRH-3H or synthetic TRH. The HPLC analysis is performed on a microparticulate (10 mu) silica gel chromatographic column with CH3CN/0,01 M NH4OAc, at pH 6 (30/70) (V/V). This technique provides a good separation of TRH and the other products of degradation.

The diet was well tolerated, and mean weight loss was 2.49 kg/week during the 4-week period. Nitrogen excretion diminished in all patients during the period of treatment, but nitrogen balance remained slightly negative in most patients, mean daily deficit being 1.3 g N/day at the end of the study. The rate at which nitrogen was loss declined in a biphasic fashion, a slower second phase after an initial rapid period of adjustment to the diet. During the study a mean of 4.1 +/- 1.4% SD of calculated total body nitrogen was lost. Potassium excretion studies did not reveal significant potassium losses. The amount of nitrogen loss was correlated with the urinary creatinine excretion, suggesting that nitrogen loss during reduced dietary intake of protein is largely dependent on the size of the lean body mass.",eng,0.7073388570391685,5

64,32,1979462,M1818731,Trends in low birthweight Canada. 1971 to 1989.,"This paper reviews the levels of and the trends in low birthweight (under 2,500 grams) and premature births (less than 37 weeks gestation) in Canada from 1971 to 1989. Low birthweight (LBW) characterized 6.6% of births in 1971 and 4.6% of births in 1989: this represents a decline of 30% in LBW for the period. The decline was evident for mothers in all age groups, and for all birth parities. However, the prevalence of very low birthweights (less than 1,500 g) remained stable during the period, accounting for 0.8% of births in 1971 and 0.7% in 1989. Preterm births (less than 37 weeks of gestation) increased from 47% of all LBW births in 1971 to 60% in 1989. This shift and the small decline in the prevalence of preterm LBW babies has clinical and preventive implications. These and other findings are based on analysis of 6.6 million single live births between 1971 and 1989.",fre,0.554105931242826,1

66,48,878528,M703466,Alcohol induced changes of carbohydrate metabolism [author's transl].,"It is evident that ethanol by itself or one of its metabolites produces alterations in transport, metabolism and disposition of carbohydrates. Ethanol acts via changes in the redox state of co-factors; e.g. ethanol-induced hypoglycemia is due, partly, to the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by ethanol as a consequence of the increased NADH2/NAD ratio in patients whose glycogen stores are already depleted. On the other hand, hyperglycemia has also been described in patients with alcoholism. Although its mechanism is still obscure, abnormal hormonal secretion of insulin, catecholamines and glucocorticoids has been incriminated. Finally, structural changes of the liver and pancreas such as cirrhosis and pancreatitis produced by chronic alcohol consumption should also be considered as pathogenetic factors in a variety of clinical states involving deranged carbohydrate metabolism.",ger,0.5425523573804192,4

The effect of graded lysine supplemented on the crude nutritional content of the carcas of laying hens.,"In the present work 8 hens taken from each of the 16 experimental groups (90 birds per group) were killed at the end of the trial period (52 weeks). The weight of the organs was determined and bones, the utilizable parts and the residual carcass were analyzed for their crude nutrient content. The experimental birds received rations containing a large proportion of high-protein wheat supplemented with varying levels of lysine. Variations in the lysine supply did not affect the mass of blood, feathers, bones, liver, stomach, heart and ovaries, including ovarian follicles. An analysis of the utilizable parts (flesh, stomach, heart, liver, follicles, fat) for crude nutrients showed that the heavier birds receiving adequate amounts of lysine contained less crude protein and more crude fat than the smaller birds. A positive correlation was found to exist between the crude ash content of these samples (expressed as %) and the levels of lysine supplied during the laying period. All the birds receiving the lysine-deficient ration during the time of rearing or during the laying period contained significantly less crude ash in their bones. Alongside with the crude ash content the phosphorus content of the bones decreased when the birds where fed the diet for laying hens.",ger,0.5423662727898615,4
