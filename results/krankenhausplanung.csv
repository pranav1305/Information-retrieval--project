Ergebnisse aus vier Neurochirurgischen Kliniken.,An audit of economicalness performed by one company from 1980 to 1985 in four neurosurgical departments is presented. The report is restricted to medical care. There is a considerable difference in findings: in the department first looked at there are 3.8 patients per surgeon and in the 1985 examination 5.4. These departments being well comparable otherwise both judgement and competence of the business consultants involved must be questioned.,ger,0.7756577203572397

1020889,M858634,Krankenhaushygiene aus der Sicht der Medizinalverwaltung,"The task of medical administration in hospital hygiene is external control, promotion and counseling. This applies, for example, to the personel sector when establishing the internal institutions: hygiene committee, hospital hygienist, hygiene commissioner, specialist hygiene nurse. In addition, it is however necessary to improve the structural and functional facilities and possibilities within the framework of the hospital finance law. This includes early, supraregional guidance in cases of hospital planning as well as cooperation in hygiene committees. Medical administration can only create the necessary preconditions for good hospital hygiene. It is , however, the task of the members of the personel themselves to make full use of them.",ger,0.7514209837967214

Definite conditions concerning to the rooms, the staff and the organisation must be realized. Most important is the cooperation between the anaesthesiologist and the surgeon.

1897864,M1736923,An analysis of reimbursement for outpatient medical care in an urban hospital emergency department.,"The investigators examined the demographic and clinical factors associated with the collection experience in a series of 786 patients who were treated in an urban hospital emergency department (ED) but not admitted to the hospital. They found that 57% of the total net charge of $150,489 had been paid within 180 days. This rate can be compared with an average inpatient collection rate of 85% at 180 days. Seven factors were found to account for the collection rate variation, making up 38.4% of the total variation. Age, gender, primary diagnosis, season of visit, time of arrival, and residence were not found to be main contributors. Insufficient collection rates may be an indication that EDs increasingly are becoming a financial risk to hospitals. The hospital's collection experience will become more important as an indicator of financial risk if the costs of operating EDs continue to escalate and collection rates do not improve. Both the costs of providing a service and the amount of the charge actually collected are valid concerns to those operating EDs.",eng,0.6134608282558398

It is particularly important for the primary care physician to recognize the difficulty of accurate diagnosis in children and the advantage of sedation in improving patient cooperation. Hospitalization may be necessary for adequate observation, proper preparation for diagnostic studies, or safe treatment. Simple traumatic injuries or infections can usually be treated effectively without hospitalization if sound surgical principles are observed. Abdominal pain or rectal bleeding calls for a careful investigation for early signs of inflammatory disease or life-threatening lesions requiring surgical treatment.",eng,0.6092535726296708

Patients' records were analysed with respect to predisposing factors, inpatient management, postoperative analgesia, hospital stay and post-management complications. One hundred and nineteen patients had haemorrhoidectomy (low ligation combined with an anal stretch). Of these, 1.6% developed urinary retention and 4.2% bled postoperatively but did not require surgical intervention. Ten patients were found to have tight anal canals post surgery and required outpatient anal dilatation. In no case was dilatation necessary for more than 3 months. Three patients required a therapeutic course of antibiotics. Of the 119 patients, 60 required narcotic analgesia for less than 24 hours. Hospital stay was 1-4 nights.",eng,0.6036334652772212

Other factors making this task more complex are related to brief nursing observations and unclear patient expectations. Care plans are now mandated in the outpatient areas at Central Baptist Hospital in Lexington, KY. The plans need to be realistic, comprehensive, and timesaving, yet generic. A checklist format, which is described in this article, was the solution.",eng,0.5989474953308931

1448063,M1286900,The perioperative care of orthopaedic and trauma patients in a high-dependency unit: a 2-year prospective audit.,There is an increasing trend towards the establishment of high-dependency units in large hospitals since it is thought that they conveniently 'fill the gap' between the intensive care unit and the routine wards. This paper prospectively reviews the results of management of 205 orthopaedic and trauma patients who passed through such a unit over a 2-year period. The unit was shown to provide effective and safe care for a group of particularly high-risk patients for whom care on a routine ward at times would be insufficient and for whom care on an intensive care unit is unnecessarily expensive and occasionally unavailable. The high-dependency unit as described in this paper represents an efficient use of resources for this group of patients.,eng,0.5972837873411307
1556557,M1395470,An audit of the management and outcome of hospital inpatients with diabetes: resource planning implications for the diabetes care team.,"In order to assess the outcome of hospitalized diabetic patients in an urban health district the notes of a cohort identified from a survey of all inpatients on a single day in spring 1990 were reviewed. One hundred and ten cases were reviewed (8.4% of all inpatients); median age 73 years (range 26-99), 59 female. Fifty-five percent were medical patients (general or geriatric) and 16% were general surgical. Six remained inpatients after 6 months. Sixteen died, of whom 10 had macrovascular disease. Median length of stay was 22 days (2-300), significantly above the district average in all specialties (< 10 days). Of 15 patients with foot problems, 5 died and 3 had major amputations. Only 23% of all patients had documented evidence of screening for diabetic complications. The discharge diagnoses failed to acknowledge diabetes in 54 cases (including 10 deaths). Only 10% had formal advice from the diabetes team and subsequent audit revealed that metabolic management was commonly suboptimal in non-physician units. These data suggest that inpatient diabetes is costly and carries a high mortality. The incidence is substantially underestimated by conventional episode statistics. The evidence from this cohort of diabetic inpatients suggests that improved communication and recognition of the importance of diabetes could usefully contribute to the quality of care achieved.",eng,0.5967232445933724

To these may be added the dynamic nature of isotope studies (cinegammadacrycystography). These different techniques may be used in the precise analysis of the morphology of the lacrimal system, from the canaliculi to the meatuses. After reviewing normal radiological anatomy, the authors describe morphological abnormalities, according to different forms of obstruction, according to their site. This morphological discovery requires possible changes in technique (additional tomography, for example).
