1919720,M1758789,Activity and post-polio fatigue.,Fatigue was studied in 12 subjects with post-polio sequelae (PPS). Results of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) demonstrated a mean score of 4.8 +/- 1.6 (non-disabled scores = 2.3 +/- 0.7). The Human Activity Profile (HAP) was not sensitive enough to measure fatigue. Fifty percent of subjects scored below the first percentile based on age and sex matched norms. The Activity Record (ACTRE) results revealed that subjects spent 5% of their time resting and 1% in planning or preparation activities. Fatigue peaked in the late morning or early afternoon and was relieved by rest periods. Use of energy conservation and work simplification skills along with frequent rest periods was suggested as a possible method for managing PPS fatigue.,eng,0.9466014723389323

125905,M28186393,Chronic fatigue in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-Hypermobile type.,"Chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health-related quality of life in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. There is overlap in the symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. A proportion of those with CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified. The evaluation of chronic fatigue in EDS needs to include a careful clinical examination and laboratory testing to exclude common causes of fatigue including anemia, hypothyroidisim, and chronic infection, as well as dysfunction of major physiological or organ systems. Other problems that commonly contribute to fatigue in EDS include sleep disorders, chronic pain, deconditioning, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunction, psychological issues, and nutritional deficiencies. While there is no specific pharmacological treatment for fatigue, many medications are effective for specific symptoms (such as headache, menstrual dysfunction, or myalgia) and for co-morbid conditions that result in fatigue, including orthostatic intolerance and insomnia. Comprehensive treatment of fatigue needs to also evaluate for biomechanical problems that are common in EDS, and usually involves skilled physical therapy and attention to methods to prevent deconditioning. In addition to managing specific symptoms, treatment of fatigue in EDS also needs to focus on maintaining function and providing social, physical, and nutritional support, as well as providing on-going medical evaluation of new problems and review of new evidence about proposed treatments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",eng,0.8918999047641691

1789482,M1628478,Chronic fatigue syndrome.,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome appears to represent a spectrum of disorders in which a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms may operate. While the initiating event in the majority of patients is a pyrexial illness, possibly due to enterovirus infection, evidence of persisting infection or inflammatory changes in muscle and/or brain remain unconvincing. CFS patients display a definite reduced aerobic work capacity compared to normal control subjects, but this may reflect a state of deconditioning resulting from prolonged physical inactivity. They also have an altered perception of their level of exertion and premorbid fitness. The characteristic fluctuation in symptoms, with periods of relapses and partial remissions, may indicate that some central disorder of sensory perception is operational. It may be that a primary sleep disorder results in a reduced sensory threshold for afferent stimuli from muscle. This could well account for many of the subjective symptoms which patients experience. Much more research is clearly necessary if we are to achieve a better understanding of this distressing and at present enigmatic disorder.",eng,0.8820086525540238
1780349,M1619343,Chronic fatigue syndrome.,"The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a poorly understood condition with nonspecific signs and symptoms, especially debilitating fatigue. Most patients can pinpoint the onset of their illness and usually describe a flu-like state. The search for an etiologic agent has focused on a number of viruses such as Epstein-Barr, enteroviruses, retroviruses, and human herpesvirus-6. Evidence supports persistent viral infection in a small percentage of CFS patients. Immunologic abnormalities do exist in CFS, which indicate the presence of immune activation in CFS patients. Although abnormal muscle biopsies have been found in some patients with CFS, strength and endurance appear normal, but perception of exertion may be abnormal. Patients with chronic fatigue have a high incidence of premorbid and concurrent psychiatric disorders, and on physical examination many often have reproducible tender points similar to fibromyalgic patients. Clinical evaluation should rule out other potential causes of fatigue, but elaborate diagnostic tests are seldom required. Presently, no specific treatment exists for CFS. A cognitive behavioral approach with or without the use of tricyclics has been advocated. Patients should be encouraged to maintain functional status and should not be discouraged from exercise. Several medications have been tried but with no definite clinical benefit.",eng,0.8820086525540238

330733,M148704,Les fractures de fatigue. A propos de 8 cas.,"Eight cases of fatigue fracture were observed by the authors. In two patients, they presented in metatarsal bones; others were in the lower end of the tibia, in the shaft of the fibula, in the patella, at the upper end of the fibula, in the shaft to the tibia and in the neck of the femur. The main features of these fractues, which occurred in previously intact bones, are reviewed. The role of previous muscle imbalance, or metabolic disturbance, (by age or in pregnancy) is discussed. Good results were obtained by simple immobilization. Surgery may be indicated in the two situations: 1. To eliminate the possibility of a bone tumour by biopsy and, 2. For internal fixation in special sites such as the femoral neck to avoid coxa vara or when healing is very slow, as occurs particularly in the femoral shaft.",fre,0.6746844400363391
1707317,M1546280,Fatigue des muscles respiratoires.,"Respiratory muscle fatigue is induced experimentally by adding high external resistances to breathing. The role played by respiratory muscle fatigue in exercise limitation and in acute respiratory failure is still unclear. The electromyogram often reflects contractions beyond the fatigue threshold, but overt force failure has been only rarely demonstrated under these circumstances. Hypercapnic ventilatory failure may possibly not result from fatigue, but rather from an adaptation of the respiratory system for avoiding fatigue. The treatment of fatigue comprises respiratory muscle support by adequate nutrition and oxygen delivery, and if needed respiratory muscle rest by mechanical ventilation.",fre,0.6366781994729649

A depletion of CD4+ T-cells down to 8% of the origin level (p less than 0.0001) followed the antibody application. Moreover, there was a significant reduction of blood monocytes to 30% (p less than 0.001). A reduced lymphocyte proliferation induced by antigens or mitogens was found in parallel. Prior to treatment, monocyte-macrophage activation in rheumatoid arthritis was signified by an increased expression of HLA-class II antigens and the CD14 antigen, and by an increased production of neopterin and interleukin-1. Anti-CD4 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of elevated levels of neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin in serum as well as IL-1 production in vitro.",ger,0.6119225489918716

The contents of Ca, Na+ and hydroxyproline increase. There is also an increased urinary excretion of adrenaline and especially noradrenaline. With simultaneous noise stress, these changes are even greater. The magnitude of the changes increases with the degree of Mg-deficiency. The changes in the contents of Na+, K+, Ca, Mg and hydroxyproline correlate with the excretion of noradrenaline.

This aspect has not been taken into consideration sufficiently yet in theory of stress. I like to stress once more that it is the excessive, too intensive stress reaction which is leading to psychic disturbances as well as functional disturbances. Stress which does not exceed a certain extent has to be considered physiologically: the organism needs it as stimulans to obtain its functions: it could not survive without this stimulans. The situation only becomes risky if the stress factors are causing pathogenous disturbances. This situation has been named ""dis-stress"" by Selye. The best guarantees to avoid ""dis-stress"" as well as psychic stress-disorders are changing of attitude of life, compensation of overstrain by sensible recreational activities, going in for sport, engagement for human and social environmental factors as well as a harmonic family-life and a conception of life in the sense of imperturbability and tolerance.",ger,0.6102408470362737

The mechanisms of MS-related fatigue are unknown but comorbid disorders play a major role. Anemia, diabetes, side effects of medication and depression should be ruled out. Moreover, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) should be differentiated from fatigue. No approved medicinal therapy of MS fatigue is currently available.!##!Objective!#!Presentation of current treatment strategies with a particular focus on secondary fatigue due to sleep disorders.!##!Material and methods!#!A review of the literature was carried out.!##!Results and conclusion!#!All MS patients suffering from fatigue should be questioned with respect to EDS and if necessary sleep medical investigations should be carried out; however, pure fatigue without accompanying EDS can also be caused by a sleep disorder. Medications, particularly freely available antihistamines, can also increase fatigue. Furthermore, anemia, iron deficits, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be excluded. Self-assessment questionnaires show an overlap between depression and fatigue. Several studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy and various psychotherapeutic measures, such as vertigo training, progressive exercise training and individualized physiotherapy as well as fatigue management interventions can lead to a significant improvement of MS-related fatigue. There is currently no medication which is suitable for treatment of fatigue, with the exception of fampridine for the treatment of motor functions and motor fatigue.",ger,0.605100182411183
