Two groups of scoliotic and nonscoliotic children were examined with selected psychological tests. No differences could be found in regard to neuroticism, extraversion, manifest fear or the children's self-image. Differences were found in regard to the social environment which scoliotic children experienced as more demanding and supportive. As a result they were more concerned with achievement in a performance situation and more confident of success. The type and extent of the psychological effects of scoliosis is determined by the position accorded to the children by the social environment. Negative consequences can best be dealt with by educating the parents.",ger,0.8087773243246598

Between primiparae, secundiparae, and multiparae, working and housewife mothers, workers, farmerettes, women doing other jobs, and academically trained women, eutrophic mature and hypertrophic mature neonates, and newly born male and female babies there was observed a roughly similar frequency of the generally accepted ""normal weight of placenta"" of 400 g to 600 g and no significance of minor differences in frequency, respectively. 2. The high incidence of mothers aged 20 and less in the ""normal placental weight group"" of 400 g to 600 g compared to 21- to 30-year-old and 31- to 35-year-old mothers was not found to be significant. 3. The high incidence of unmarried mothers in the ""normal placental weight group"" of 400 g to 600 g compared to married mothers is not significant, the higher incidence of premature labor in unmarried women being due possibly, not to the weight of placenta, but rather primiparity, age under 20, and social class. 4. The higher frequency in the placental weight group up to and including 400 g of married compared to unmarried mothers, primiparae compared to secundiparae, primiparae and secundiparae compared to multiparae, working mothers compared to housewife mothers, and workers and farmerettes compared to both women doing other types of jobs and academically trained women was not found to be significant.",ger,0.8049779109863647

Overchallenging of the functional capacity of the parathyroid gland may evoke an insufficiency of the parathyroid gland which on its part induces a fetal secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the early diagnostic recognition of the insufficiency of the parathyroid gland is of importance, since (also in basic diseases known before pregnancy) now special therapeutic conditions are given. Maternal hyperparathyroidism leads to fetal hypoprarthyroidism with resulting developmental disturbances; it furthers the tendency to abortions and perinatal mortality. Epidemiological prospective investigations have shown that among the identified cases of oligo- or asymptomatic functional disturbances of the parathyroid glands there are very often women at an age, when they are capable of bearing children. This statement confirms the postule regularly to control serum calcium content during pregnancy. Objectifying the disturbed integrity of the calcium metabolism, therapeutic measures are necessary, the details of which are demonstrated according to own experiences. In such cases the cooperation between the gynaecologist being in charge of the pregnant woman and the internist working in the field of endocrinology is to be wished.",ger,0.7974584755568621

The presence of triamterene resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of furosemide xantinol induced diuresis in both species. It was necessary to reduce the amount of triamterene present in the mixture to approximately half that of the one theoretically required according to considerations of the recommended therapeutic doses of the two diuretics before significant inhibition was avoided. Nevertheless, this reduced amount of triamterene proved sufficient to inhibit the distal tubular exchange of Na+ for K+ and H+ and a mixture formulated to give the ratio of 40 mg furosemide xantinol (as base) plus 25 mg triamterene (Salidur) was shown to produce a smooth but efficient loss of water and Na+ in the absence of detectable kaliuresis or reduction in urinary pH, thereby reducing the usual risk of inducing hypokalaemic alkalosis.",ger,0.7951134892904029

1185631,M1023527,[Results of the systematic control of tuberculosis in the People's Republic of Poland according to the development of the epidemiological data till 1975 (author's transl)].,"After the second World War a marked improvement of the epidemiological situation in the field of tuberculosis has been achieved in Poland. In 1952 the incidence of tuberculosis amounted to 490 per 1000 000 of the population; the prevalence to 1400. The mortality rate was 105.8 in 1950. In 1974 the incidence rate has been reduced to 81.4 (among them 49.4 excretors of tubercle bacilli), the prevalence rate was only 248.9 (among them 78.3 with excretion of tubercle bacilli and 11.7 with chronic tuberculosis--persons excreting tubercle bacilli for more than 2 years). The mortality rate from tuberculosis amounted to 13.8 at this time. The most sensible reduction of all indices was found among children 0-14 years old. Tuberculosis in Poland is still a problem of medico-social importance in adults and before all in old people, being that part of the population in past times only in a low degree vaccinated or revaccinated and in a higher degree exposed to severe infections with tubercle bacilli. The comprehensive complex programme of tuberculosis control passed by the Sejm of the Polish People's Republic, includes three approaches since 1960: the epidemiological, the integrating and the phthisiopneumological direction. Prerequisites for the scheduled realisation of the programme are the case-finding as early as possible, the quick and correct diagnosis and the immediate onset of a specific treatment, further on the dispensary care of all contacts of the patient (his surroundings) and optimal prophylactic measures against tuberculosis.",ger,0.7931858169205176

Patients of the age group of 20-24 years were overrepresented (p less than 0,05) as well as patients of the lower socio-economic classes and patients whose parents were less than 20 years old at the time of the patients' birth. The structure of the family in childhood showed significant differences concerning patients with different social contacts and different diagnoses. Patients who grew up in big families have themselves a relatively large number of children and vice versa (p less than 0,01). A significant correlation (p less than 0,01) consists also between the number of siblings of the patients and the socio-economic class they belong to: Patients from the underprivileged socio-economic classes mostly grew up in big families.",ger,0.7853621720843029

Simple mastectomy appeared to be the operation of choice because survival following this procedure was equal to that following more radical operations, but the morbidity was less. Partial mastectomy was found to be an unsatisfactory method of treatment. Simple mastectomy should be combined with removal of the lower axillary nodes to allow accurate staging of the disease. Postoperative radiotherapy did not influence survival, but did increase morbidity. It may be best to restrict its use to the treatment of local recurrance.

We investigated how mixed and redundant information carried by neuroreceptors could be efficiently coded by output neurons in the second neuronal layer in the brain. We showed that a good discrimination is yielded if neuroreceptors that terminate on the same output neuron belong to several types, if these types are in different proportions for each output neuron, and if each output neuron exerts an action on all others so that their independence is maximized, according to the Jutten and HÃ©rault algorithm for separating linear mixtures of independent sources. The proposed model details the computations made by neurons and leads to a better understanding of several observed properties of the olfactory system, among which the inhibitory actions of local neurons of the second layer and the identifiability of insect glomeruli.",fre,0.7702656264019376

The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review was the privately owned older journal, and the American Journal of Nursing was the voice of the professional organization. Each journal was edited by a strong nursing leader, Janet Geister and Mary Roberts, respectively. Each editor had many years of service to the nursing profession in varied capacities. Naturally, each had distinctly different interests, visions, and styles of communication. These editors witnessed and commented on the change in the sphere of nursing practice from a private duty and public health orientation to one that eventually became dominated by the hospital. Although their approaches differed, both recognized the need for organization, versatility, and creative problem solving. However, the legacy of these leaders must be considered in view of the gap that continues to exist between practicing nurses and the American Nurses' Association leadership.",eng,0.7219725010183333
